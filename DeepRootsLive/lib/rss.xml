 <br>Day 26 of Bloomweave, 515 T.A.?<br>A new dawn found me stirring from a deep slumber within the cosy confines of the <a data-href="Froggit About It" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/businesses/froggit-about-it.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Froggit About It</a> inn. As I rubbed the sleep from my eyes, I made my way to join the others aboard the <a data-href="Crimson Gaze" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/factions/crimson-gaze.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Crimson Gaze</a>, a ship unlike any I'd seen before. There, after being treated to a drink by <a data-href="Mirri" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mirri</a>, amidst the raucous revelry of pit fight celebrants I was engulfed by waves of wyrmroot smoke that bridged my senses with the ethereal plane due to no fault of my own.<br>My memory is a bit fuzzy beyond this point beyond the recollection of the incredible colours I witnessed that night, but I do distinctly recall searching for a vantage beyond the ordinary, and so I climbed to the crow's nest where one Wisp presided a card deck and fortune-telling stones. I inquired the stones about <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Malachi" data-href="Malachi" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/malachi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">the Stonecutter</a>, and <a data-href="Wisp" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/wisp.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Wisp</a> translated their symbols of loss, zeal, and wealth to me — a cryptic foretelling that left me pondering what shared fate might await both the Stonecutter and myself.<br>Once I was on deck below, I observed <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Luck of the Draw" data-href="Luck of the Draw" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Luck</a> after a while, the pipe at his lips casting shadowy swirls, punctuated by red motes igniting my curiosity. Paired with the raven-like shadow I saw about him earlier, one might paint me curious as to what might hide behind that otherwise jovial and pleasure-forward self-presentation of his.<br>The evening waned and weariness took hold, in any case, drawing us back to the inn, sinking into a sleep filled with homesickness — a yearning for the familiar places traversed and those left behind in cross-planer my journey.<br>The light of morning revealed an unforeseen ailment, as <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> displayed their scaled arm, an unnerving gift from the abyss. Corvaux called it <a data-href="Phage" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Phage" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Phage</a>, and suggested we all get examined by the healer at the <a data-href="Heart Tree" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Heart Tree" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Heart Tree</a>. There, we encountered <a data-href="Kelsea" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/kelsea.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Kelsea</a>, who confirmed Corvaux's singular plight among us, and spoke to us of the <a data-href="Silver Maple" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Silver Maple" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Silver Maple</a>'s condition, <a data-href="Scarlet City" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Scarlet City" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Scarlet City</a>'s past with the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Pale Blight" data-href="Pale Blight" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/terms-and-phrases/pale-blight.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Blight</a> (and suggested there may be more recently contaminated individuals in town) — which, now that I'm writing about it, feels like ... we should not leave without investigating, right? What if we come back and the town is in disarray due to an outbreak?!<br>Impromptu crisis aside: we were pointed to the Drunken Cantor for the tools to shield ourselves against the corruption should we choose to venture into Silver Maple (though we are first going to Autumn, as far as I'm aware).<br>A murmur about the taste of decaying honey upon contamination with the drew a grim blanket over all of us. Scarlet City knew the Pale Blight's touch — a crisis mirrored in Corvaux's <a data-href="Yewdon" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/yewdon/yewdon.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Yewdon</a>, sealed but festering for centuries. Our paths reconciled in a sense; most of us seem willing to assist him in Silver Maple once the time to head there comes, though I admit to finding myself somewhat relieved we are first going after Mirri's <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Vestan Tlanbourn" data-href="Vestan Tlanbourn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/vestan-tlanbourn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tlanbourn</a> – as far as I'm aware, at least. I sense a distinct reluctance among some of us to follow a near stranger into what may turn into certain death.<br>Not to say that facing this Tlanbourn will be any different, but at least I know Mirri a touch better — well enough to throw myself into a fight for the sake of exacting justice by knocking him down a peg or two. I feel like we've bonded just enough to achieve that much, but, then again, I have been called a gullible cretin in the past ...<br>Either way, we're getting exactly nowhere without doing some shopping for the bare necessities, if we can call it that. Luck pursued a Moorbounder kitten while a frost puppy, <a data-href="Grout" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Grout" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Grout</a>, suddenly claimed a share of our lives as well — Mirri and I now as co-parents to this frosty, bounding ball of joy.]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-22.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Aerendyl 22.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 26 May 2024 15:45:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ralph]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br><br>Haunted one background, hoarder<br><br>Timeline: <br>
<br>birth til 50 - you can pick the lifestyle/courtly status
<br><br>
<br>50ish - the Spellplague struck, the effect lasted about 15 years
<br>50 to 125ish - travelling, learning, performing, this is probably when the relationship with eddie might have started?
<br>125ish - when she was tricked by the <a data-href="Furthest Branch" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Furthest Branch" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Furthest Branch</a> (haughty Autumn nobles in this necromantic cult) and kept as an "artist-in-residence"
<br>125ish til 135 - kept by the <a data-href="Furthest Branch" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Furthest Branch" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Furthest Branch</a> in a museum-esque mansion built in the branches of a massive tall tree in the north of the oak forest. Maybe she tried to escape but was always dragged back by either Eddie or the magic curse that keeps her near the mansion
<br>135ish years old -Mio tries to run away again, and realizes the Great Upheaval had began. Oak's corrupt nobles and Authority were attacked by claw and tooth and root as <a data-href="Silvanus" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/silvanus.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Silvanus</a>'s primal warriors rose up to challenge the evil Archfey. The <a data-href="Golden City of Oak" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Golden City of Oak" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Golden City of Oak</a> fell as the tree that supported it was burned. During this time, all the members of the <a data-href="Furthest Branch" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Furthest Branch" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Furthest Branch</a> were called away to fight the wildlings that were "destroying our heritage".

<br>135ish - 350ish (present) - Lived in the manor alone (except for some animal friends and your Unseen Servant). The manor was richly stocked with books, art, instruments, clothes, alcohol, other drugs, portions and elixirs, magic components for spells, and more. 
<br>Two vaults - one that Mio managed to get open - the other is still locked shut, containing thousands of gold and the Mask/Sunglasses of Daywalking, among other things. 
<br>During this time, maybe she enchants her own lite, the magical one you picked out. Being able to levitate up and down to get up to the mansion after hunting would be important.
<br>during the nearly 2 centuries, Mio discovers she can get as far as 10 miles away from the mansion, but if she goes any further, she feels compelled to return. If she ignores this compulsion, her ears and nose and eyes start to bleed and she takes small but steady psychic damage. 
<br>also during this time, you can decide how she learns that she can hear the voices of the dead. Not all dead - but some. Mostly humanoids, those that have souls, but maybe also a fey creature once, like a faerie dragon or an elemental. We can brainstorm this together if you want

 <br><br>Autumn is the Court of Forests. Some of the oldest records in the universe can be found in the dryads' libraries. Scholars from across the realms come here to study and learn, and many study their whole life without leaving again. Autumn has the deepest connections to beasts and fauna - many have remarkable control over druidic wildshaping skills. Some Autumn courtiers live their entire life in the cities at the center of each archfey's forest, never once walking upon the ground itself. In some places, the trees reach up past the clouds, and it is said that if you climb high enough, you will find giants living in stone clouds that levitate miles above the ground.<br>
Each forest has a certain amount of autonomy, but all are united in their deep roots and ancient histories. Autumn may lack in military strength or technological advances, but the knowledge and texts curated by the archfey are priceless.<br>

 <br><br>Summer is the most technologically advanced of any of the seasons, developing steam power, airships, and more. Most of the arable land is taken up with farming, and Summer grows the bulk of the grains eaten across the entire plane.

Summer boasts of a magnificent airship fleet, the most advanced of the Season's Courts. Summer is also famous for having learned to work with rare and unusual materials, utilizing dangerous substances like cold iron, quicksilver, and even lightning itself. The Quellwrights who handle these deadly materials are both feared and respected for their knowledge and skill. <br><br><br><br><a data-href="Lord Shade" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Lord Shade" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Lord Shade</a> and <a data-href="Lady Shine" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Lady Shine" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Lady Shine</a> co-rule, a balance of youth and experience, poetry and steel, innovation and tradition.

 <br>Session log – diary entry style – for Aeren’s first session on 21/09/2023! (I’ll fix any bad formatting once I’m on my pc 😬)<br>Today was the day I left my home in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sandfall City" data-href="Sandfall City" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/earth-plane-(elemental)/sandfall-city.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sandfall</a>, and set out on my journey to seek out the Stonecutter – starting in the <a data-href="Hallowhymn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/hallowhymn/hallowhymn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Hallowhymn</a>s on <a data-href="Rakāuvi" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/rakāuvi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Rakāuvi</a>, with the intent to venture on to <a data-href="Nordthorn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/nordthorn/nordthorn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Nordthorn</a>. Luca's troop of vendors and guards was a formidable one. I'd never seen bulletes as tame as the ones pulling the carts!<br>The subterranean passageway towards the portal held more wonders still. One could argue I should be used to the wonders of this elemental plane of ours, but the swirling sands and the large, shimmering mithril cobblestone that made up the path and the coloured, swirling sands were magnificent to behold. Perhaps it was sentimentality reigning supreme and making my admiration so overt...<br>The impracticality of the path's structure unfortunately meant one of the carts got stuck, and not long after, one of us fell and injured herself. As it turned out, this tunnel housed ravenous sands — and they’re known to thirst for whatever blood they might find. A single drop was enough to draw them our way.<br>A stumbling start to the fight that ensued eventually led to our victory, but poor <a data-href="Stox" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Stox" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Stox</a>, the satyr merchant, almost perished for it. <a data-href="Vigil" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Vigil" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Vigil</a>, a tiefling that (like myself) joined this convoy as a guard, helped me rid Stox of the monstrosity, fortunately.<br>It was welcome twist to what could’ve been a grim ending of the first leg of the journey, but I don't have the words to describe the next chapter.<br>HALLOWHYMN. What a sight! I've never seen earth float so high, over a vast ocean many leagues below. The sky was bluer than any crystal I've ever laid eyes upon, and the clouds in the distance towered to mind-boggling heights, appearing reflections of ice-capped mountain peaks. The trees on the floating islands produced songs with the shifting winds. Turns out they have holes in their trunks – who would have thought?!<br>As my awe subsided into relief, Vigil sought me out to give me a parting gift: an amber pendant of warmth, to keep the cold of the Nordthorn mountains – my next destination – at bay. He won't be joining me there; other destinations await him. I don't know if the battle, the gesture or both have instilled me with a sadness to part ways with him, but I hope to see him again someday.<br>For now, I must find myself either a kite to glide down to Nordthorn at the risk of plummeting to my death, or find passage on a ship …]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-0.5.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Aerendyl 0.5.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2024 13:45:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aerendyl 0.56]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Session log for Aeren's 2nd session, with @zaqurie's Bell :sparkles: <br>Today was not the quiet trek towards the tower I had expected. Fortunately, I encountered a stranger during the last leg of the hike, just a stone's throw from the tower the Stonecarver described in his diary. They were rather better dressed for the cold than I was — but I had <a data-href="Vigil" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Vigil" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Vigil</a>'s pendant to keep me warm along the way.<br>We chose to venture on together – and as I write this, it occurs to me that I never even got his name … how foolish of me – just as the onset of a blizzard began to engulf the slope in snow, and us along with it.<br>I briefly investigated the altar in front of the tower, having read that, despite its incredibly narrow construction, people have entered it, as well as the seven other visible towers along this mountain range. Allegedly, entering them and completing the trials within would grant access to a ninth, otherwise invisible tower … Either way, I found no instant way of opening any doors, though; only a clawed hand print of sorts and a sigil – with dwarvish runes – on the ground. Arcana never was my strong suit.<br>After briefly lamenting the fact I could not more thoroughly investigate this tower so similar to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Lady Sunnis" data-href="Lady Sunnis" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/lady-sunnis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sunnis</a>’ back in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sandfall City" data-href="Sandfall City" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/earth-plane-(elemental)/sandfall-city.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sandfall</a>, my newfound companion and I ventured on and up the mountain. There, we found the entrance to a cavern of sorts.<br>The stranger seemed unsettled by it, but it was certain death under a thick blanket of snow, or braving the possibility of it in this game. We chose the latter.<br>Inside, we found two cultists – at least, I think they were. We observed quietly from a height along a ledge as they performed their ritual about a large sigil on the cavern floor, decorated with Draconic sigils. Fitting, then, that they later also spoke Draconic to each other. I also noticed a stone door of sorts on the wall directly below the drop.<br>My companion and I before long decided on a two-pronged approach to figure out what was happening. I tried distracting them – clumsily – with conversation, while my companion circled around the other side.<br>He, however, decided to end my evident uncertainty and propel things onwards by somehow conjuring a massive iron door, and dropping it on them. Needless to say, they were unhappy with us for that. I'll spare myself the ink by stating we overpowered the two as they attempted to complete the ritual hastily.<br>We found a league of items on their bodies. One of them held a light crossbow + 20 bolts, light leather armour, a scimitar, dagger ( silver filigree-covered , both blade and hilt ), the scrap of paper he’d been clinging to – with an alphabet I don’t understand –, a rough sort of circle with notes indicating different parts of the sigil on the floor. Also a half dozen empty vials, a dark brown stain in them; like they once contained blood.<br>The other held similar items, except his dagger was obsidian. We unmasked the cultists, one of them a high-elf, and the other a dwarf. On the latter, we found remnants of a tattoo below his neck, between the shoulder blades. It was a circular pattern with curved, jagged lines, reminiscent of a sun with an empty centre, or a whirlpool of sorts. Perhaps it was even a directional guide of sorts?<br>We examined the door as well, but I can’t read the writing on it, nor could I open it. However, after contemplating for a while as we rested, I am almost certain the writing is also draconic. Shrines in the temple in Sandfall displayed this script, and these were dedicated to (allegedly) one of the first dragons to ever exist.<br>My companion and I parted ways as the storm died down, and he was kind enough to gift me some gold for the road ahead.<br>So, in short, it seems we stumbled upon a dragon-worshipping cult of sorts. I’m not entirely sure how this ties in to the eight ( or nine, I suppose ) towers, if it at all. Maybe I’m imagining things, but it all seems too odd to be a mere coincidence. I’ll have to think on the matter a while longer …]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-0.56.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Aerendyl 0.56.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 21:58:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aerendyl 0.57]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Session log for Aeren's 3rd session, with <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a>!<br>Day 19 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age.<br>Two days ago, on the 17th, I set out along the <a data-href="Ghastbane Cliffs" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Ghastbane Cliffs" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ghastbane Cliffs</a>, my home for the past decade, in pursuit of insight into the reports of trees and other flora having been destroyed beyond repair. The Moonshade moss has been flourishing, at least — I remember wondering if that might have to do <a data-href="Lucanthus" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Lucanthus" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Lucanthus</a>’s turquoise shine during its rotation across the sky, before I came across a mangled tree at last.<br>It was as though a massive paw had crushed it. Large, wide-footed tracks of some beast with four legs led this way and that around it. Something reptilian came through this way … I couldn’t stop to consider it for long, as a shrill whistling noise passed overhead, and the earth trembled with a force I’ve not felt the immense rock slides and avalanches I witnessed in the northern mountain peaks of <a data-href="Nordthorn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/nordthorn/nordthorn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Nordthorn</a>.<br>The only thing there was to do, was to follow the quaking to its source, farther towards <a data-href="Baheera" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/baheera/baheera.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Baheera</a> still. A pile of boulders that have never once moved in all the times I have crossed this area, has shifted, revealing odd markings. In hindsight, I wish I could have more closely examined them — but the gaping hole in the ground some ways off more urgently called for my attention.<br>A cloud of ash (I assume) hung all over and about it. It was so dense at first, I didn’t even notice the person hiding below it, before going off the examine the odd, feather-like patterns the ash seemed to fall into on the ground.<br>The stranger, Corvaux, revealed herself to me. I admit, I thought her a strange one at first, speaking of delusions — assuming I was a delusion, and one of ‘the wrong kind of yellow’ at that! She seemed unfamiliar with even the most mundane parts of this world. The sky, the sun, the concept of rain and rivers — all new to her. Surely enough, she revealed she isn’t from here, and doesn’t quite know how she got here, either.<br>But things got more interesting, still. Again I heard the noise and felt the trembling, and Corvaux and I set out together to chase it to its source (as I did not wish to leave her behind here). We come across a river, plummeting down a waterfall. I know this area well, but not the odd creatures populating the area. At first glance, they seemed a simple bear and a toad, but they shone with a yellow, powdery substance I could not place …<br>The bear was not responsive to my magic in the sense that I’m used to, either. Where I would usually be able to have some semblance of a conversation with a bear such as itself, this one simply parroted my words right back to me. Corvaux revealed her suspicions as my unease grew: these animals were infected with something she’s witnessed in her home.<br>We couldn’t let these animals go unchecked, and let this infection spread. Though it pained me at first to kill these creatures, it turned out they were no animals at all — I don’t know what to call them, still, but they were insectoid … unknowns. They dissolved after the fight, leaving but their yellow stains on the ground.<br>Unfortunately, one of them got to me; infected me with its poison. The itch all throughout my body was indescribable, and I don’t know if I’d have ever gotten rid of it without Corvaux’s help. She brewed an antidote of Moonshade (or Moonshadow!) moss – or two, actually – and taught me the recipe for it. It should serve as protection from any future poisoning if imbibed ahead of time, too.<br>Once I’d recovered enough to carry on, we decided to excavate the infected soil and deposit it in a wheelbarrow. There was no knowing whether it might spread through the ground, and that was not a risk I was willing to take. We depart towards the <a data-href="Circle of Seven" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Circle of Seven" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Circle of Seven</a> to find my peers that have specialised in purification rituals and the like, so they may learn of this new threat and find out how to prevent its spread, should the worst come to pass and more of these creatures turn out to be about.<br>Along the way, we felt and heard another rumble and for a moment, the sun disappeared from the sky. Something flew overhead, something massive, holding what turned out to be buildings in its mighty claws! Corvaux recovered a piece of paper that fell from one such building and recognised the script as Draconic. The creature, meanwhile, ventured farther south and into Baheera. I feared for <a data-href="Tornwing Haven" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Tornwing Haven" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tornwing Haven</a>’s safety, so we sped there as fast as we could without throwing about the infected soil.<br>Thankfully, the settlement was unharmed, but its citizens were disturbed by the sighting I just described. Little did they know of my (and likely Corvaux’s?!) suspicions that this incident and the infection must be related to each other. Coincidences exist, but none of this magnitude. They can’t.<br>At length, we started gathering more information about what the locals saw. I reached out to my circle and local clerics to help us cleanse the earth. Meanwhile, I took what time in between I had to recover from my wounds and monitor the purification of the earth. Corvaux passed on the recipe for the antidote, and shortly after, we set off into the Baheera desert to seek more answers.<br>So far, we’ve been led to a place that is believed cursed. Lovely!]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-0.57.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Aerendyl 0.57.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 22:00:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aerendyl 1]]></title><description><![CDATA[

It was the first actual settlement I'd seen in days – that is, a settlement with solid buildings, rather than yurts and tents belonging to nomads.<br>Given the relentlessness of the sun beating down us the past couple of days, Corvaux and I made way for a tavern (<a data-href="Serenity's Rest" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Serenity's Rest" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Serenity's Rest</a>) to rest up, first of all. As luck would have it, we wound up stumbling head first into gossip about precisely our topic of interest: the nearby ruins. Other people have already beaten us to them. There is now a massive digsite, apparently, with interested parties having themselves lowered into the ground to discover whatever relics they might find there.<br>Corvaux and I had our meals and drinks first, and with by some good fortune and a few ales, we managed to strike up a useful (and pleasant!) conversation with some other patrons. They told us of the history of this oasis; of how it used to span many more miles across, until a magic cataclysm of sorts sent fire raining from the skies, and set the town aflame. Only this small part of the former grand town is now inhabited. People here do not view magic favourably as a result, and avoid the remnants of the burnt down parts of the settlement almost as a form of superstition.<br>Good, now that we have that bit of interesting context out of the way, and I know to keep my casting to a minimum: the dragon we've been chasing, crash-landed just outside the village. I didn't realise we were that close, but a bit of good news is always welcome.<br><a data-href="Imarin" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Imarin" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Imarin</a>, a Tabaxi blacksmith, mentioned his sister, <a data-href="Aziza" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Aziza" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aziza</a>, went there with a crew and to manage all the comings and goings of those who are lowered into the hole. Perhaps we can find her and gather some more information once we're there ... He spoke about sandstorms, too – we need to ask the <a data-href="Duskwardens" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Duskwardens" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Duskwardens</a> about those for any details, so that's what Corvaux and I set out to do once our tankards had run dry.<br>We meet someone named <a data-href="Jalis" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Jalis" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jalis</a> by the entrance. Inside of the tower, we saw massive sheets of canvas, depicting basic maps of the settlement. Differently coloured ribbons and strings, red here, blue there, depict weather patterns across them. They're not too dissimilar from diagrams my circle used to predict the weather.<br>Having taken in these maps, I'll have a better understanding of what to expect when we're out in the desert once more. I also see a storm is approaching, set to reach these parts some hours after tomorrow's dawn. By early afternoon, we'll be unable to move through it without risking our lives, and these circumstances will not wane for another two to four days. Corvaux and I had best set out overnight.<br>Jalis told us at least fifty people have already passed through the settlement to visit the ruins. She also tells us about what we might expect when we make our way there, too – such as strange moving lightning; balls that descend from the sky remain in place until someone comes close enough for them to strike. Sometimes, they descend into the sands only to never be seen again, resulting in the surrounding sands becoming electrified. If encountered, we should cast some type of counterspell upon sight or prepare ourselves to be exposed to their charge.<br>We’ll also find mephits, and, if we're not careful, ravenous sands …<br>Jalis eventually suggested one of the Duskwardens join us as a guide:<br>
<br>Nahiri Swiftpaws, one of the Tabaxi locals.

 <br>Session 2 log: Day 20 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age<br><a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> and I contracted <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Grunk the Mighty" data-href="Grunk the Mighty" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/dig-team/grunk-the-mighty.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Grunk</a> to take us to the ruins in the desert. Before we even set out, though, a great beam of golden light came down into the desert (or was it going up from the desert?). The locals told us it apparently meant someone was in the ruins of the south side of the old city — more specifically in the 'testing tower’, attempt to … well, take its tests. I still wonder if this somehow relates to the lit towers of <a data-href="Nordthorn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/nordthorn/nordthorn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Nordthorn</a> …<br>Either way, we set out as intended on our 3 - 4 hour hike once Grunk was ready to go, intent on reaching our destination before the morning's sandstorm would roll in. But we got curious about the light, of course, so we asked Grunk to take a detour with us towards that light. He told us that there where the light touched down, the temple of <a data-href="Hystaa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/hystaa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Hystaa</a>, goddess of Justice, lies. Apparently, the light served as a ‘bell gong’ for Hystaa's clerics and other devotees. The tower is meant to judge whether the temple's visitors are worthy of entrance into its archives.<br>Just as we approached the tower, we crossed paths with another traveller — a dragonborn of some noble standing. <a data-href="Lady Liatris" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/lady-liatris.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Lady Liatris</a>, she introduced herself as. She wound up joining us for the final stretch, and I must admit, I was rather content for it.<br>Before long we came across a tent pitched next to a barely opened well. Corvaux spotted a letter there, written by a <a data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaddeus Quill</a>, requesting a rescue if he wasn't back by tomorrow (the 21st).<br>Lady Liatris managed to carve away some of the heavy, solid stone lid on the well, and Corvaux – with troublingly little forethought – decided to try climbing down the hole. We couldn't even see where it ended! What we also couldn't see was its taper. She could've plummeted to her death then and there!<br>Fortunately, she made it back out alive, after which I forced my climbing kit on her. Our minds had somehow gotten made up about one thing in the meantime: we did want to make our way down there. Especially Lady Liatris seemed intent on doing this, as she'd recognised the name on the letter.<br>After gracelessly shouting down the well, a small, red … dragon? shot up from the well and whizzed right past us, and what do you know? Mr Quill spoke to us through the little rascal! He tells us the way down is about 200 feet, so for those with no climbing kit, we decide to tie together all our ropes and Grunk makes a ladder of it.<br>He made an awful noise anchoring it to the stone, but given the lack of other options, I can't rightfully blame him. Either way, we all made our way down at length in various ways. Spiderwalk made it a smooth trek on my end, and fortunately permitted me to catch our dutiful guide mid-plummet down the hole. His hand must've cramped, or something …<br>We landed in a room with coloured, lit up circles on the ground and strange, red flowers around the edges. A single sheet of blank paper was left on a pedestal in the centre of the room. Upon investigation we realised we needed to sign our names on the paper – or otherwise identify ourselves, as one would in a guest book. A licked thumb was apparently enough, likewise Lady Liatris’ signet ring pressed into the paper with some blood of hers. This opened a door into a hallway, but not before another large beam of light shot up. That answered my question as to the precise origin of the light, at least.<br>Going through the door felt like passing through the portal in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sandfall City" data-href="Sandfall City" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/earth-plane-(elemental)/sandfall-city.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sandfall</a> … As I looked back to see if it was indeed a portal, a fresh, unblemished piece of paper sat on the pedestal. Interesting.<br>The next room had a table with all sorts of papers and scrolls on it. On the floor we also found a geometric pattern drawn with yellow paint. Not even a bird's eye view could help me recognise what it was meant to signify, unfortunately.<br>This left me with nothing to focus on but the table and everything strewn across it. All the scattered sheets reminded me of my father's the Stonecutter's journal. Different parchments textures, ages, styles of writing … a collection of oddities. Corvaux and I realised these were all personal accounts, knowledge, recipes, notations on maps, poems with annotations, et cetera.<br>Corvaux revealed we were meant to contribute to the collection with something personal of sorts. I drew Sandfall, adding notes here and there, and signed my initial below it.<br>Some 30 feet above, massive images suddenly appeared on the walls. A view of Sandfall from <a data-href="Lady Sunnis" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/lady-sunnis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Lady Sunnis</a>’ tower appears. It revealed metallic gleams and glints, showing the veins of metals and veins from city. On another wall, the <a data-href="Straterra University" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Straterra University" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Straterra University</a> which father helped build, with the Lapis Lazuli dome on display, encrusted with diamonds — just as magnificent as I remembered! Another wall depicts some of the more dangerous paths, with homes built into the cliff-walls that constantly fluctuate and shift under the element's force. I realise these are other people’s perspectives on my home …<br>The others see my entry only after they add their own to the pile, and vice versa.<br>In Lady Liatris’ ‘vision’, I recognise a portal to the Earth Plane. I'll have to ask her about that later – where exactly it was and what she might know of the portal and where precisely it leads, at least.<br>Grunk’s vision shows how not to die in the desert. Plain, but useful. The imagery teaches us of two different types of cactus: one is edible, one is poisonous. The differentiations in root structures and clusters of the spikes are what tells them apart, apparently! [Insert a messy sketch here]<br>The next door opened as a result, so off we go to see what secrets the following chamber holds!]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Aerendyl 2.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 22:10:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aerendyl 3]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Session 3 log: Day 20 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age<br>The next room we wound up in, held four statues. I couldn't figure out of whom or how they related to each other, but it seemed fairly clear that we were to make a donation to the fountain in the centre, with the fox statue on top of it. It was full of coins and trinkets, so I added a silver piece to it.<br>Before long, another portal-like exit ( or entrance … ) opened up, pulsing with violet light. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Grunk the Mighty" data-href="Grunk the Mighty" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/dig-team/grunk-the-mighty.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Grunk</a> and myself stepped through first, followed by <a data-href="Lady Liatris" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/lady-liatris.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Lady Liatris</a> and <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a>.<br>It took us into a space darker than the backs of my eyelids, and I felt as though my heart was floating freely in my body. Whatever tension I held in anticipation swiftly vanished, and at that same point in time, three questions were posed — not aloud, but in the confines of my own mind:<br>
<br>What do you seek?
<br>What will you do with this knowledge?
<br>Who are you?
<br>I answered as honestly as I knew how to, and divulged I was looking for whatever lies at the end of this route through the tower to find its purpose; that I hoped this knowledge would further my venture to figure out what the dragon has been getting up to ( and why ), and that I am Aerendyl, a druid, son to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Malachi" data-href="Malachi" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/malachi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">the Stonecutter</a> and <a data-href="Özge" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Özge" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Özge</a>.<br>We all wound up in another room yet. Behind me, seemingly endless stairs led the way back up. The room itself held a statue of dragon on a basalt pedestal; no bigger than a wyrmling, with violet scales that refracted light, carved out of a single amethyst formation. Quite the stunning piece to look at!<br>According to Grunk, dragons ( as far as he's aware ) don't have any particular ties to <a data-href="Hystaa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/hystaa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Hystaa</a> ( and I asked, as this is Hystaa's tower, after all ). They're known for their sense of justice, but other than that … nothing quite explicit.<br>In this same room, we also met up with <a data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaddeus Quill</a> at last. We exchanged introductions, and come across draconic script at the base of the pedestal on which the statue is situated. A riddle, apparently: Enter and Wait, You Who Tempt Fate. Outlast or Outcast, Clever Hands Hold Fast.<br>We all decided to take a rest before proceeding, and I thought no more of it. I instead took to decrypting more of the Stonecutter's journal. This time, I asked Corvaux to help me.<br>Her unique linguistic capabilities and general eye for patterns helped me reach new insights. She noted the sheets are about finding someone, or perhaps a group of people – tracking a story, or rumours, about someone? A thief; a betrayer. The Infernal script apparently has a thing or two to say on those who break their promises. It's powerful; almost like a curse. Is the Stonecutter the betrayer in this story?<br>I'll have to find the answer another day (with Corvaux’s help, as she offered to teach me the language!), as we soon decided to head into the next room. There, we spot overlapping spiralling markings. Their light began pulsing, faster and faster, like something was counting down for us.<br>We all decided to wait until the light was barely flickering at all – then it brightened more still, while the room itself grew dimmer. The statue’s light behind us faded, and figures tall, lurching figures appeared atop the spirals. Their faces were like masks with too many eyes and rows of teeth. Their trinkets were reminiscent of those I saw in the fountain…<br>One of them reached towards Thaddeus, and before long a fight ( of sorts ) broke out. My attention was tugged back to my past by the mere gaze of one of these creatures, when I lived happily at home with my parents.<br>Suddenly, everything in the world seemed fine. I was pulled through time, rushing through events. I was trying to find the figure that took my eye in exchange for its gift, and the amber eye that replaced it … I wound up dwelling on it, relaxing from this combat, suddenly, thinking of the triumph and transformation. The connection then broke, and I lurched back into the present.<br>I soon realised these were people, or entities, from the <a data-href="Feywild" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Feywild</a>; Secret keepers.<br>They spawn and thrive in the deepest shadows of society, housing deception and obsession. The energy of that constant vigilance of all things social and the continuous nosing into all business can become strange, tangible aberrations. These aberrations keep searching for more to satiate their curiosity …<br>These Secret Keepers are pure magic beings, feeding off the energy of those around. They’re easily influenced by the atmosphere in which they live. I warned Lady Liatris of this, but she paid it no heed. Corvaux eventually pulled her out of one of the the Secret Keeper’s reach.<br>A minute and then some, and the creatures fade along with the light. The room regains its former, arguably more natural lighting.<br>Before long, though, Lady Liatris stepped into one of the circles and the lights change again, reminiscent of the bright hues of the portal from my home to <a data-href="Rakāuvi" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/rakāuvi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Rakāuvi</a>. Luca incanted and woke the portal with some components at the time, almost coaxing it to bathe us in its light.<br>I snapped out of my reminiscence as the two Secret Keepers showed up again. This is where I started thinking these bright, colourful circles might be portals, perhaps requiring a material component to be ‘gifted’, like the previous rooms did. Simultaneously, I wondered if these could be entryways into the Feywilds, or if they were one-directional …<br>But their distinct shade of violet must have reflected the school of conjuration, implying ( to my mind ) unidirectionality – in hindsight, at least.<br>Thaddeus and Lady Liatris try to speak to them in any language they know; anything with any roots in Fey tongues. Lady Liatris’ <a data-href="Sylvan" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/languages/sylvan.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sylvan</a> gets their attention, unsurprisingly. That was about as constructive as it got, because she soon started to attack them again.<br>I ran out of energy to heal her before long, and she fell. Corvaux and Grunk stabilised her, fortunately, but I can't help but wonder about the necessity of her chosen course of action. I simply don't see it.<br>I stepped forth to take her place in engaging with the Secret Keeper, in any case, after seeing Thaddeus gift the other a piece of amethyst. I recall thinking that ‘Clever Hands Hold Fast’ might signify that the Secret Keeper, reaching out as it was, might simply have wanted its hand held. Idiotic. By the gods, don't know what came over me to think such a thing.<br>I can't remember what happened next. The first thing I do recall, is that the next moment, I was in agony. I was ( and am ) missing the first two knuckles of my left forefinger, its remaining stump bleeding and hurting. Somehow, I seem to at least have had the sense not to offer up my dominant hand.<br>The next thing I noticed, between the white-hot flashes of pain, is Lady Liatris, passed out on the floor, vanishing — or fading away, in some sense. She just disappeared. In my peripheral vision, I saw the dragon light up in a warm tone. Approval, perhaps?]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-3.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Aerendyl 3.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 22:17:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aerendyl 4]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Session 4: Day 20 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age<br>What a day, indeed. We were granted access to yet another room after offering the dragon statue a piece of silver. This new room, too, held a statue – albeit a rather eroded one – with another riddle:<br>
Test of Trust, Strong Hands Muster. Path Laid Plain, Harm Brings Pain
<br>There was also a chalk design on the floor, vaguely reminiscent of one of <a data-href="Tornwing Haven" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Tornwing Haven" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tornwing Haven</a>'s meditative walking paths my peers from the <a data-href="Circle of Seven" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Circle of Seven" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Circle of Seven</a> would traverse when posed with a particularly stubborn disease, cure or other ailment. The challenge in the adjacent space, however, had nothing to do with healing.<br>It felt like a dark pocket realm of some sort. There was an oval-shaped ring made of what seemed to be obsidian, decorated with more designs in all sorts of colours with orbs at their centres, and broken train tracks across the gap in the middle of the ring. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaddeus</a> took lead, and after his initial examination, we all joined up, gathering the orbs along the way and slotting them into this statue's staff – to no immediate effect, but … what else could be the purpose of such a perfect fit?<br>On the statue's headband, we read: <br>
walk beside me, you who brave the path. 
<br>It was as clear an indicator we were meant to push the statue across the tracks, including the gap about halfway through, and so we did, all four of us.<br>Along the way, three motes of lightning materialised out of nowhere — I think they were playing with us, in a way. Thaddeus managed to shepherd most of them away at length, and apart from getting exposed to a few zaps, we reached the terminal of the tracks safely, upon which the statue, the orbs and the lightning all simply vanished.<br>Lo and behold: the statue in the first room appeared as new upon our return! Now, it's time we rest – we've been on our feet for too long already.<br>Day 21 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age<br>Our day started with yet another flight of stairs that needed traversing, followed by one more chamber with a statue. This one, a figure folded into themself with wings wrapped about them, revealed no riddle; it only evoked a keen sense of melancholy. I got the impression this would have to do with the trial ahead, and so we all set out into the adjacent space.<br>It took us outside, in a sense, into a husk of a campsite. The fireplace was dishevelled, broken items lay strewn about, and the tent was hardly worthy of its name. Inside it, we found an ailing person — hypothermic. Given that everything around her, including her bedroll, was wet, that was no surprise.<br>Foolishly, I did not think to offer the amulet <a data-href="Vigil" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Vigil" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Vigil</a> gave me. It's kept me warm on so many cold nights, I might as well have fused with it at this point. Bygones and all that …<br>To keep a long story short: we fixed things around camp, decorated a makeshift grave or tribute to a deceased loved one, and provided the sleeping person with renewed shelter, food and warmth.<br>(Though, I will admit to finding the contents of that grave – of sorts – will stick with me. The string about the pouch of contents I found in it was capped off with a hexagonal coin that read ‘Remember all things live. Remember all things die.’)<br>Upon sensing we had helped the person in question, we moved back into the other chamber. The statue had changed – it almost seemed a different statue entirely: open, content, and bearing gifts! I was given a cleansing stone. (I love stones!)<br>With our new items, we return to the room that started this particular branch of the journey – the one with the statues and the fountain. Its door had finally opened to us, and the room it revealed was ( and is ) nothing short of astonishing. A massive tree stands at its centre, its branches seemingly iron with silvery leaves. There’s all manner of items around the periphery of the room, too – a massive crystal, a compass, so many scrolls, books, and more than I can describe. Time to find out!]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-4.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Aerendyl 4.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 22:18:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aerendyl 5]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>[Session 5] Day 21 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age<br>This entry will be a messy one, but I suppose all that matters is that it makes sense to me. So: we spoke to <a data-href="Caspian" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/library-of-unseen-horizons/caspian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Caspian</a>, the one responsible for the upkeep and, I suppose, protection of the archive in <a data-href="Hystaa's Tower" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Hystaa's Tower" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Hystaa's Tower</a>. We discussed the dragon <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> and I saw — and apparently, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaddeus</a> and <a data-href="Lady Liatris" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/lady-liatris.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Lady Liatris</a> did, too, about three weeks prior to our encounter, quite a ways from here, by the <a data-href="Halls of Ancestry" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Halls of Ancestry" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Halls of Ancestry</a> up … north, I believe? I should confirm with Thaddeus or Lady Liatris sooner rather than later.<br>Our talks again yielded these images across the walls; like whatever we shared in conversation would have its visual counterpart projected onto the structures. It was an incredible watch.<br>At one point, the note that fell from one of the buildings that the dragon was hauling with him, was revealed to be millennia old — from a time where astral wyrms invaded the material plane, leaving glitches in the fabric of reality at their points of entry.<br>Hardly any sooner in this overwhelming flurry of revelations, Caspian revealed a framed painting of what turned out to be the Halls of Ancestry in the <a data-href="Basalt Caverns" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Basalt Caverns" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Basalt Caverns</a> of my home plane. That area was far away from <a data-href="Sandfall City" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/earth-plane-(elemental)/sandfall-city.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sandfall City</a>, nearer the border of the <a data-href="Fire Plane" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Fire Plane" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Fire Plane</a>, and burrowed deep underground. I've only heard of it, unfortunately.<br>Alongside the Basalt Caverns, three other areas host ( apparently less ‘famous’ ) Halls of Ancestry:<br>
<br>one floats the astral sea, to be found via astral projection (think about it long enough and you’ll get there), and the lair of a solar dragon, apparently;
<br>one in the the <a data-href="Feywild" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Feywild</a>;
<br>and one on <a data-href="Rakāuvi" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/rakāuvi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Rakāuvi</a>, which was in south <a data-href="Sylvari" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/sylvari/sylvari.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sylvari</a>, but has since moved to <a data-href="Baheera" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/baheera/baheera.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Baheera</a>.
<br>Caspian revealed these Halls are shrines to the draconic parents and five dragon spirits, as well as a way of preserving draconic history — feats, battles, blood lines, et cetera, as well as records of those that have done or would do grievous harm to dragons.<br>Thaddeus revealed that this dragon they sighted at the Halls of Ancestry (formerly in Sylvari) was called ‘The Old One’? It might have been a protector of that site and decided to leave – with half the construction in tow?! – upon being besieged by thieves and other such rotten folk. At least, that's what I managed to cobble together while listening to Thaddeus’ explanation.<br>Corvaux and I also asked about the yellow dust we found near <a data-href="Tornwing Haven" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Tornwing Haven" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tornwing Haven</a> and all that entailed. Caspian tells us about the <a data-href="Pale Blight" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/terms-and-phrases/pale-blight.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Pale Blight</a>, named by a myconid of the autumn court in the Feywild. <a data-href="Juniper" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Juniper" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Juniper</a>. It was brought to the forest of the <a data-href="Silver Maple" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Silver Maple" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Silver Maple</a> deliberately; fissures in the fabric of reality led to the <a data-href="Abyss" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/abyss/abyss.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Abyss</a>, where the blight bled through, and demons, too, would enter this plane through.<br>Once the archfey ruling over the forest had been deliberately crippled by her enemy, she sealed off her forest from within to prevent the spread of the Blight. It stayed sealed for 20 years – until a group of heroes from the Feywild began to decipher what had happened, including Juniper, apparently … could this be how it wound up so close to Tornwing Haven? Where else might it have since spread?<br>I shared with Caspian that we detected the blight by Tornwing Haven, for posterity’s sake. Corvaux shared the recipe for the antidote, in return for which the recipe from the <a data-href="Autumn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/autumn/autumn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Autumn</a> Court shows up on the wall behind Caspian. They tell us they’ll be in touch if they find any new information about the Blight.<br>Before we departed the library at last, Caspian tells us the hexagonal token works as a sending stone of sorts, and that the tokens’ capacities will expand over time. Something to keep an eye on! <br>Upon returning to the first chamber of the tower, we found Lady Liatris again. She was different than how I remembered her — folded into herself, as if in some sort of shock. Humbled, even. Once we asserted she was well enough to travel and willing to come with us, we set out. I'll spare any future finders of this diary the details, so in short: we decided to set out for the ruins straight away to stay ahead of the approaching storm.<br>Upon arrival at the ruins after a ( fortunately! ) fairly uneventful trek, Lady Liatris opened herself up to us to a surprising extent, apologising for any offence she may have caused. It was a brief heart-to-heart in the end, but I was grateful to have been included in it. To cap the conversation off, she even gave each of us a scale off her own tail — a gesture I expect is more significant amongst her kind than I could really know.<br>We set off as a group after that, towards the hole. I ( unsurprisingly ) got sidetracked by a dancing figure. It seems a ritual, like she's casting magic – transmutation, as it turned out. The structure of the statue she was circling around shifted with every touch.  After I try to strike up a conversation with her to ask about it, a nearby worker revealed that she won't tell me what her ritual – I presume – is about; she's faithful to the <a data-href="Tides of Silence" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Tides of Silence" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tides of Silence</a>, a group of mystics interested in the deep dragon (some type of water dragon?), which I assume means she took an oath of silence? <br>With my curiosity somewhat sated, I joined the rest and we ventured down the hole via the platform (safer that way, especially for Corvaux after she took two falls trying to climb out of the tower just hours prior …). The air was ( and is ) different, cold and humid; the darkness is too ominous for my liking. <br>There's all manner of things to see in the chamber we just wound up in. A statue of Tiamat, a passage with sand dunes layered about it, stairs leading farther down, a huge archways, and a subterranean lake … Now, off to explore all these areas!]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-5.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Aerendyl 5.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 22:24:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aerendyl 6]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>[Session 6] Day 21 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age<br>This cavern is a maze of things to explore, truly. By some stroke of luck, I was pulled into one direction over another. Though, I will leave this note to myself: must return to the water later to take a dive and see what the light in the water is about. It might just be a shrine to <a data-href="Nexus" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Nexus" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Nexus</a> … Details will follow once I've actually verified.<br>In the past few hours, I've gone a different route. Along with <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a>, <a data-href="Lady Liatris" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/lady-liatris.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Lady Liatris</a> and a priest called <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Xandri Khalkos" data-href="Xandri Khalkos" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/dig-team/xandri-khalkos.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Xandri</a>, I stepped into the small, rectangular building after its interior somehow was unlocked while I hemmed and hawed over that light in the water.<br>It wasn't just any room, though. Upon entering, I was cast into a dream I had as a child, before <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Malachi" data-href="Malachi" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/malachi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">the Stonecutter</a> left. It was rather a bizarre dream, but one that shook me to my core and left me weeping in my bed at the time. I dreamt of the Stonecutter's death – or, rather, finding out about it. My juvenile self found him in a bed outside, having passed all alone, nursing the same stone I have embedded in my chest. Perhaps it was a warning of some sort – of whom I would lose and just how fast, at that.<br>I awoke from that moment that couldn't truly have lasted more than a few seconds, but it felt like a lifetime spent in that liminal space between the past and the present; conscious and subconscious. As I opened my eyes, I found we were all not in that small building we entered; not really. It turned out we found the shoreline of the <a data-href="Astral Sea" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Astral Sea" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Astral Sea</a>, for lack of a better word.<br>Convictions and willpower rule supreme here. Priestess Xandri displayed as much by floating off of the cliff we wound up on. She suggested that dream and my new understanding of it might have been <a data-href="Aesa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/dragon-spirits/aesa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aesa</a> (Weaver of Dreams) reaching out, in a sense — and most importantly, that I should likely decide on whether to chase more dreams and therefore insight before I sleep next.<br>I had more questions I would've asked (what would opening myself up as such entail, for instance?), if not for the thunderous noise that summoned us back to the main cavern. Another note to myself, then: Find Xandri later …<br>Upon return to our realm, we found <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaddeus</a> had managed to open the gate another passage or area. With our ragtag group reunited, we all set out to explore this new discovery, and land ourselves in a chamber fringed with enormous amethysts, their cores pulsing with various colours. I almost felt like home …<br>We came upon a large, hexagonal structure at the centre, surrounded by several piles of stone. After some trial and error (involving testing the order and orientation of the stone slabs, and reading characters suspended in the amethysts themselves), we managed to unlock a tune of some sort.<br>Upon mimicking it, the doors leading into the hexagon opened, and we were immediately greeted by a corpse. Lovely! Gods, moments like these make me miss life back in <a data-href="Tornwing Haven" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Tornwing Haven" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tornwing Haven</a> … but I digress.<br>This is where things got interesting. Lady Liatris and Thaddeus recognised the corpse – or their attire, I suppose? Either way: I, too, recognised the mask belonging to the corpse. I spoke to them of my adventure with <a data-href="Bell" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Bell" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Bell</a> years ago, back along the peaks of the <a data-href="Nordthorn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/nordthorn/nordthorn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Nordthorn</a> mountain range; about how we sought shelter from a storm in a cavern, found a pair of bumbling cultists attempting a summoning of some sorts, and even the detail about the ten foot door Bell dropped on them.<br>I revealed one of the masks I found on the corpses, briefly touched upon the tattoo on one of the cultists’ neck (that sun with the empty core), and the draconic script found along the door in the cavern wall, and what I recall of it from the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sandfall City" data-href="Sandfall City" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/earth-plane-(elemental)/sandfall-city.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sandfall</a> temple dedicated to one of the first dragons.<br>( Now that I've looked back on my old entries, I also recall Bell said he was from an area close to a ‘cursed forest’ … Could that be the forest that was sealed off to contain the <a data-href="Pale Blight" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/terms-and-phrases/pale-blight.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Pale Blight</a>? The ‘root’ of that infection on this plane, that the crystal dragon tried to protect it from?

 <br>[Session 7] Day 21 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age <br>We didn't quite get around to figuring out was on the murals. All I managed to glean from the panel with the Terran <a data-href="Primordial" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/languages/primordial.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Primordial</a> script ( with <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaddeus</a>’ assistance ) was that it described the temperaments of different stones, and the potential repercussions of imbuing them with power – or life, even. It seemed the dragon-esque statue in the centre of the room might've been meant as the object of an experiment involving giving life to stone ..? <br>I hope we can come back to figure it out, alongside the contents of the other panels, because before I knew it, ever enthusiastic Thaddeus set off and we all felt compelled to follow suit. We wound up in a hallway below, where we found <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Professor Ssimmia Hakani" data-href="Professor Ssimmia Hakani" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/dig-team/professor-ssimmia-hakani.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Professor Hakani</a> and <a data-href="Eldanor Nightbloom" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/dig-team/eldanor-nightbloom.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Eldanor Nightbloom</a>.<br>We found some weird things here. Stone that seemed to cling to life, a few doors … I myself was instantly drawn to the first on the left side, recognising the symbolism of the half-cut diamond as belonging to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Dounuma" data-href="Dounuma" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/dounuma.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Dumathoin</a> ( or Dounuma, if you prefer ). Not too surprising, then, that I wound up in a very neatly-kept … crypt of sorts, after opening it.<br>The scent of incense, quite like the type used in elven funerals, hung suspended in the air, and a large window afforded a view of massive amethyst formations outside, framed by utter darkness.<br>The room itself contained four sarcophagi, each adorned with different symbols and decorations. A discussion with Professor Hakani has me wondering if these might be disciples of four of the five great dragons – excluding <a data-href="Aesa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/dragon-spirits/aesa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aesa</a>, as some of her most ‘advanced’ followers do not die, per se; not as we know it. They transcend this way of living and may not die at all in this plane.<br>After a while of pondering and swapping ideas with the professor, I hear voices coming through another door in the chamber. I proceed through it, and find <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> chatting with a stranger in a laboratory of sorts, accompanied by another dragon-like creature.<br>The stranger, named <a data-href="Xilo" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Xilo" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Xilo</a>, mentions the four buried in the previous chamber are ‘the ones that came with the books’. What books? Why? I couldn't tell you, dear reader. I'll have to ask later and document what I learn.<br>We all conversed a bit – though I took on more of a listening role than anything else. Corvaux handed over the paper that fell from the building the dragon carried overhead before we set off into Baheera, and apparently this was part of some long-lost book; Xilo also mentioned something about the <a data-href="Firmament" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Firmament" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Firmament</a> ( disciples of <a data-href="Gereth" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/dragon-spirits/gereth.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Gereth</a> ), and then the conversation veered towards a blood sigil Thaddeus and Corvaux found.<br>When the two set off in its direction again, I followed along — not expecting to be of much help, really, but you never know, right? Too bad Thaddeus and Corvaux wound up figuring out something's already made use of that sigil and weaselled its way into the room, and invisibly so at that.<br>And what an ugly ( and powerful ) demonic bastard that turned out to be … a quick scribble of two blades crossing to signify the fight that broke out closes off that sentence – like ⚔️ <br><img alt="summoned_demon.PNG" src="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/lib/media/summoned_demon.png" style="width: 200px; max-width: 100%;">]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-7.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Aerendyl 7.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 22:30:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/lib/media/summoned_demon.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/lib/media/summoned_demon.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aerendyl 8]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>[Session 8] Day 21 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age<br>We faced yet another near-death experience today in our quest to cleanse the library of the demon roaming its hall. Even fighting together, our attacks barely fazed the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="summoned_demon.PNG" data-href="summoned_demon.PNG" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/images/creatures/summoned_demon.png" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">demon</a>. Its claws and fangs tore into us, dropping <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> to the ground broken and bloodied, with myself near enough following. I feared our number was up. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Professor Ssimmia Hakani" data-href="Professor Ssimmia Hakani" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/dig-team/professor-ssimmia-hakani.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Professor Hakani</a>, <a data-href="Tallie" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Tallie" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tallie</a> and <a data-href="Lady Liatris" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/lady-liatris.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Lady Liatris</a> joined the fray, with the latter helping us heal our wounds before any of us would cross over permanently.<br>In a last desperate act, I summoned the power of nature and ripped the demon's head clean off with a thorn whip, after which its body disintegrated before our eyes. We had won, but just barely. After picking up our unconscious allies, we retreated to the living quarters to recover over a meal prepared by our host, <a data-href="Xilo" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Xilo" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Xilo</a>.<br>Over the meal, we satisfied our curiosity about each other's pasts and the like. Corvaux revealed her Shadar Kai heritage for the first time upon being … confronted, perhaps, about the dark, powdery substance substituting for blood in her body. Quite normal and not at all alarming, apparently.<br>We also took a less-hurried look at Thaddeus’ forearm, revealing what had up until now remained hidden beneath his sleeves. Obsidian formations there now lay surrounded with magical veins of swirling oranges, reds and yellows, resembling lava flows. It brought to mind fire genasi and even magma para-genasi — some elemental force must be at play here. Corvaux did mention that given our presence in a place of dragon worship, perhaps it was one of the five dragon spirits. <a data-href="Pyra" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/dragon-spirits/pyra.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Pyra</a>, maybe? But to what end?<br>The more questions I ask, the more unknowns I end up with.<br>The markings on <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaddeus</a>’ amulet were also an object of curiosity during our meal. Upon inspection, I recognised protective runes etched into the grand arches of <a data-href="Straterra University" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Straterra University" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Straterra University</a> back home in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Sandfall City" data-href="Sandfall City" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/earth-plane-(elemental)/sandfall-city.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sandfall</a>. In that particular case, they supplemented <a data-href="Lady Sunnis" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/lady-sunnis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Lady Sunnis</a>' protection, meant specifically to off-set any seismic and sonic damage before it can occur.<br>Nightbloom perused the text in kind, at one point even humming a few harmonic notes. She revealed the notation system was some kind of astral musical script used to record the language, which is actually sung and whistled. Thaddeus seemed quite fascinated — which is only fair, given that his fate has been tied to whatever resides in that amulet. All I know is that the entity is called <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thousand-Eyed Deceiver" data-href="Thousand-Eyed Deceiver" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/demons/thousand-eyed-deceiver.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Zirel</a>.<br>I left Thaddeus and Nightbloom to their work,  throwing myself back onto the translation of my father’s diary. Corvaux and Lady Liatris were already off to an adjacent chamber to work on learning how to handle a dagger (with Corvaux being the obvious teacher). This left me to pore over the infernal texts alone, which, to no one’s surprise, yielded me absolutely no new insights.<br>Once we’d all rested up and filled our bellies, we returned to the blood sigil in the library. We knew that, if fed the sacrifice of a soul, it would open a portal to the abyss. The more often the portal opened, the more stable it would become until remaining permanently open after enough activations.<br>We also knew it could be destroyed by holy water, but had none available to us. Before we could plan our next move to find some, or seek an alternative cleansing method, Lady Liatris seemed compelled to offer her draconic blood, gripped by an urge from the dagger – gifted by <a data-href="Tiamat" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/tiamat.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tiamat</a>? – she obtained. Though we pleaded for her to stop, she proceeded as intended all the same. Her reckless gambit left her drained white as a ghost, and her blood was swallowed by the sigil ( to no further horrendous effect, fortunately ). In frustrated rage, Corvaux stormed off.<br>We then scrambled to collect all sharp objects as her body drained of colour, hoping to avoid any more "accidents" that might continue fuelling this evil portal.<br>Hardly any sooner than that, Corvaux's cry of "Emergency at the stairs!" rang out from the stairwell …]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-8.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Aerendyl 8.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 22:33:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aerendyl 9]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Session 9 Day 21 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age<br>As <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Eldanor Nightbloom" data-href="Eldanor Nightbloom" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/dig-team/eldanor-nightbloom.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Nightbloom</a>, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaddeus</a> and I caught up to the others, <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a>'s dire warning continued echoing through the stairwell – we were all to be careful not to fall in battle, lest our corpses be dragged down to feed the sigil below.<br>Emerging upstairs, we found ourselves in the chamber full of amethyst and those … ‘singing stones’ again, the space now fully illuminated. Two wounded were steadily being dragged towards the stairs by two more invisible demons as a new horror unfolded.<br>Nightbloom stood steadfast beside me, unsheathing her adamantine shortsword, which glinted that menacing, yet mesmerising shade of adamantine green. I understood we were to stand guard here, blocking any further descent.<br>Once acid started seeping from the nearest fiend’s still invisible body after receiving its first wounds, it was somewhat easy to pinpoint its location. Enough so, at least, to allow an approximate aiming of Thunderwave. As before, this ( fortunately ) revealed its nightmarish form to all of us. Nightbloom then pinned the creature in place for all of us to chip away at it ( at no small personal expense on her end, judging by the look of it ), before she finished it off. This time, I managed to protect my eyes just in time to prevent any blindness from its acid spray.<br>Moments later, another crack of thunder exposed the second demon as it approached, amidst the frenzy of violence unfolding among us all. Perhaps these beasts in general are vulnerable to thunder …<br>It seemed unperturbed, continuing to drag its intended sacrifice towards Nightbloom and myself, until one of the unfamiliar faces swiftly ended its advance with a strike of a hammer — compressing its head with enough force to send its corrosive acid into my eyes before I had the chance to shield them again.<br>Somewhere between trying to blink the gunk away, the fresh memory of the figure behind the hammer bearing down on our foe came to me. I recalled them blessing some of our allies earlier — perhaps they can help us attain the holy water we require to perform the cleansing downstairs?]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-9.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Aerendyl 9.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 22:34:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aerendyl 10]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Session 10 Day 21 and 22 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age<br>After the skirmish, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Obsidian" data-href="Obsidian" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/animal-companions/obsidian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sid</a> returned, confirming the area was clear of lingering demons for now. Still on edge, <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> approached the cleric, Beckett, about aiding in a cleansing ritual below. In exchange for coin (or draconic relics, as they later clarified), they offered two vials of sanctified water. I pondered trading a silver dagger I found on a solid decade ago back in <a data-href="Nordthorn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/nordthorn/nordthorn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Nordthorn</a>, but as far as I could tell, it lacked the draconic touch these two were after. Instead, I relinquished the ironbark mask – decidedly more draconic-looking – and 30 gold pieces in exchange for two vials of holy water.<br>Weary from battle, our band descended into the underground library to rest. <a data-href="Garth" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Garth" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Garth</a> soon got to work preparing a meal as we all claimed our spaces among the bookshelves and debris. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaddeus</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Eldanor Nightbloom" data-href="Eldanor Nightbloom" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/dig-team/eldanor-nightbloom.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Nightbloom</a> were already there, with Nightbloom looking positively drained of all energy. Restraining that demon upstairs must have really sapped it all out of her. In an attempt to provide some semblance of comfort, offered her and the others some of the stalest tea known to man (listen: I didn't realise the leaves were stale ...).<br>To my surprise, Nightbloom later presented Corvaux with a feather-like dagger that seemed meaningful. My curiosity was peaked, but I didn't have the heart to butt in to ask about it. It seemed a rather significant moment between them. Perhaps I might ask a question or two about the significance of the weapon later ...<br>When morning came, we were set to destroy the profane sigil painted onto the floor. Thaddeus made the first move, verdant energy pouring from his hands as he petitioned otherworldly aid. Corvaux’s attempt at singeing the sigil with a Sacred Flame backfired, but my silver dagger – once I had a late epiphany about silver's role as a countermeasure to fiendish influences – managed to shatter several focal points. Pockets of vile gas escaped through the fractures, negated by Thaddeus wresting control of his channelling, whereafter Garth’s strikes intimidated the last defences into submission – while I waved the dagger like I was possessed by some furious spirit, and Corvaux tossed whatever the exact contents of her herb pouch were to bolster the efforts.<br>The sigil yielded at last; we'd closed the door to the 108th layer of the abyss!

 <br>Session 11 Day 22 of Bloomwave, year 515 of the Third Age<br>( apologies for any errors; I could hardly keep up with taking notes during the session 😂 )<br>On this day's dawn, I returned to the subterranean lake to investigate the shimmering light beneath the water. Upon diving in, I found a stone door that slid into the wall, the mechanism of which had been damaged by some force, providing me with an entryway. Beside a few scattered fragments of a boat and some cloth, an illuminated rune came into sight. A stone arch, untouched by harm, guarded another door. Upon it lay draconic texts that coiled around an engraving of a serpentine dragon. I couldn't read the texts, unfortunately, but I'm assuming this had everything to do with <a data-href="Nexeus" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/dragon-spirits/nexeus.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Nexeus</a>, the dragon spirit of water.<br>
Insert sketch of the rune here, lol<br>Given the urgency of the matters we addressed back in the Archives, we decided not to further investigate any findings for now. Therefore, once the storm's died down, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Grunk the Mighty" data-href="Grunk the Mighty" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/dig-team/grunk-the-mighty.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Grunk</a>  guided us back to the Archives. <br>Inside, we heard voices from within: strangers. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaddeus</a>, with his cavalier spirit, strolled ahead while <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> and I hung back for a moment … until we heard him cursing. We'd never heard him cursed before!<br>Our new acquaintances had ( and still have! ) unusual marks on their faces. An elf, who later introduced herself as <a data-href="Mirri" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mirri</a>, had markings that Thaddeus attempted to read aloud – an act that was immediately interrupted. Something along the lines of ‘beneath mine eye does this vessel …?’. Her companion, a blue half-orc with the name of <a data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Runa</a>, exhibited a far more succinct sign on her forehead – a <a data-href="Deep Speech" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/languages/deep-speech.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Deep Speech</a> symbol signifying ‘hunter’, drawing fear and respect to those who understand its meaning.<br>All very interesting, but what immediately shook me to my core, was a revelation that felt like a blow to my gut: Mirri had seen <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Malachi" data-href="Malachi" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/malachi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Malachai</a>, only two days prior in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Court of Aetheria" data-href="Court of Aetheria" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/sylvari/court-of-aetheria.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aetheria</a>, <a data-href="Sylvari" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/sylvari/sylvari.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sylvari</a>. He had been caged in a farm, unwilling to reveal his fate or destination, and had spoken in <a data-href="Terran" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/languages/terran.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Terran</a>, or perhaps it was <a data-href="Primordial" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/languages/primordial.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Primordial</a>. Mirri, Runa and a cleric travelling with them had freed him. Mirri showed me a sketch of the cage, and divulged that Malachai had mentioned <a data-href="Straterra University" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Straterra University" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Straterra University</a> during her conversation with him. With a racing heart, I committed to find out more from her and Runa, the latter apparently being the one to have brought him to a safe house of sorts.<br>Mirri confessed her long search for a man named <a data-href="Vestan Tlanbourn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/vestan-tlanbourn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Vestan Tlanbourn</a> for fifty years, wanting to seek out the people he has harmed. I still can't really discern what ‘harmed’ entails, but given this figure's apparent relation to Thaddeus’ patron, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thousand-Eyed Deceiver" data-href="Thousand-Eyed Deceiver" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/demons/thousand-eyed-deceiver.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Zirel</a>, I don't imagine it bodes very well.<br>Thaddeus himself recognized the name as an alias of an expelled alumna of the Arcanium he'd attended – one Silas Crowl. We learned of his attempted theft of information regarding a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Crown of the Faceless King" data-href="Crown of the Faceless King" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/items/crown-of-the-faceless-king.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">crown of a ‘faceless king’</a> and stealing books of high-level enchantment, facilitating the strictly regulated ( if not forbidden? ) mind control.<br>Meanwhile, Runa was conducting her research on poachers, who, according to her laconic explanation, hunt magical creatures. Mirri and I offered some help, after which I gained some insight into her specific mission after recognizing the dwarven intricacies in her armour and the <a data-href="Stonesong Sentinels" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/factions/stonesong-sentinels.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Stonesong Sentinels</a> insignia on her ring. We at length found out the poachers she's after were last sighted in the <a data-href="Winter" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/winter/winter.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Winter</a> Court, capturing winter creatures.<br>After much discussion, we decided our next step would be to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Feywild" data-href="Feywild" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">the Feywilds</a>. We had options such as returning to Aetheria, Sylvari, or heading back to the Elemental Plane of Earth via <a data-href="Hallowhymn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/hallowhymn/hallowhymn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Hallowhymn</a> ( though that would serve no real purpose, according to Mirri her target appeared to no longer there ).<br>As much as I would wish to chase straight after Malachai, my personal endeavours felt woefully unimportant in comparison to the threat <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaddeus</a>'s labours under these days, <a data-href="Entities/Player Characters/Mirri" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Entities/Player Characters/Mirri</a>’s quest to find <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Vestan Tlanbourn" data-href="Vestan Tlanbourn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/vestan-tlanbourn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Vestan</a>, <a data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Runa</a>’s noble calling regarding these poachers, and, of course, the <a data-href="Pale Blight" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/terms-and-phrases/pale-blight.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Pale Blight</a> that has somehow made its way into <a data-href="Rakāuvi" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/rakāuvi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Rakāuvi</a>.

 <br>Session 12 Day 22 of Bloomwave(?), year 515 of the Third Age<br>
(Time works differently here. Who knows what date it might really be!)<br>
Before the imminent departure to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Feywild" data-href="Feywild" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">the Feywilds</a>, we take a moment to pen letters to those who hold a place of significance in our hearts. My heart clenches at the thought of never returning, of succumbing to the unknown, but the risk beckons us boldly. We choose paper birds as our messengers, capable of carrying our last words for up to fifty strides.<br>To <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Malachi" data-href="Malachi" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/malachi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Malachai</a>, I scribe a letter sharing my path ahead—|the Feywilds—and my resolve to find him in the wake of our endeavour's success or failure. And to <a data-href="Aoife" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Aoife" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aoife</a>, I spill my gratitude for the wisdom she imparted upon me; the teachings that armoured my spirit for what lays ahead.<br><a data-href="Caspian" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/library-of-unseen-horizons/caspian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Caspian</a>, with that pervasive air of mystery clouding him, transforms the passage, opening a doorway to <a data-href="Mosskarm" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/winter/mosskarm.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mosskarm</a>, our gateway to the other side. The space we step into bears significant resemblance to our departure point but embellished with a grander tree and an overall tidier presence. A Caspian lookalike – <a data-href="Calahan" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Calahan" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Calahan</a> – awaits us there, ready to reveal secrets etched into the walls at our questioning.<br>Their projections illustrate most of the <a data-href="Winter" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/winter/winter.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Winter</a> Court, with fiery spheres that burst, magma flowing, and  two moons behind the Mosskarm peaks, one steadfast, one ever moving.<br>A myriad of plans sprout amidst us—gathering supplies, gathering whispers—while <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> advises caution, insisting on aliases to mask our true selves in this beguiling realm. And so the masks we don, adopting names not our own:<br>
<br>Aeren morphs into <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Aerendyl" data-href="Aerendyl" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/aerendyl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Kohatu</a>.

<br>Thaddeus cloaks himself as <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ted Barney</a>, with a third guise of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Dath Lliuq</a> secreted away.

 <br>Session 13 Days 22 - 23 of Bloomwave, year 515 T.A<br>
Things got rowdy in the inn, as I let myself be roped into a chugging contest with <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Runa" data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Anur</a>. I lost, spectacularly, ending up unconscious and carried off to bed. I came to with a jolt and a nosebleed thanks to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Runa" data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Anur</a>'s efforts to wake me up, and we got into a bit of a half-hearted argument. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Corvaux" data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Varus</a> stuck by the entrance while <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mirri" data-href="Mirri" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mirabelle</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ted</a> stepped out. Didn’t really see much of them afterwards until this morning, actually.<br>Unforeseen sidenote: a bit out of the blue, Anur kissed me, somewhere between calling me short and calling me ugly. I'm not sure where that came from or what to think about it. Will need to think on that when I can get a quiet moment to myself again. Or not. Maybe I should just forget it, and maybe I will.<br>Following ... that, she insisted we talk to the halflings performing on stage. Varus came along ( or, rather, we just about begged her to, being the only one not completely preoccupied and sober, at that ). We bought the performers some drinks before getting into their story about bloody scenes in the snow and the destructive work of the poachers Anur's hunting. Somewhere along the way, we vowed to join them the next day as they head into the snow. We turned in for the night at length after that. <br>This morning, I found the scar on my hand is healing better than expected, with a new, opalescent stone-like quality emerging from the regenerated skin. My wounds have never quite healed like that, so whether I should be concerned by this or not remains to be seen …<br>Upon reconvening with the others, Ted informed me he obtained some new intel from <a data-href="Dex" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Dex" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Dex</a> about an entity called <a data-href="Orionis" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/devils/orionis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Orionis</a>, an archfey that landed themself in hell, possibly linked to his patron <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thousand-Eyed Deceiver" data-href="Thousand-Eyed Deceiver" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/demons/thousand-eyed-deceiver.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Zirel</a>. The specifics of Ted’s intel are somewhat unclear to me – in fact, at this point, I’m only aware of half of what needs to be done by all my travelling companions –, but he allegedly needs to find the <a data-href="Free Sprites of Spring" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Free Sprites of Spring" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Free Sprites of Spring</a>, quite a while away from here.<br>Mirabelle, meanwhile, seemed to have had a rough morning, looking outright distraught until she realized people were starting to wake up. She threw on a blanket and put on a happy front when greeting the rest of us. Seems like she's pushing through whatever's bothering her. ( Something to do with this Tlanbourn she’s chasing? )<br>As it stands now, we’re set to make sense of the day ahead. We're prepping to face what might come in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Feywild" data-href="Feywild" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">the Feywilds</a>, combating poachers, learning about ominous entities, and handling unexpected personal developments — all while maintaining the ruse that we’re a family of some unhinged type.<br>Note to self: Mirabelle and Varus are sisters in-law ( Varus married Mirabelle's late brother ). Anur and I are newlyweds, or was it recent divorcees? And Ted, well … apparently we just plucked him off the streets. I should probably circle back to this before we head out to make sure ...]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-13.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Aerendyl 13.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2024 23:51:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aerendyl 14]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Session 14 Days 22 - 23? of Bloomweave?, year 515 T.A.?<br>We left the <a data-href="Crimson Inn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/businesses/crimson-inn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Crimson Inn</a> and followed <a data-href="Trisandra" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/trisandra.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Trisandra</a>, or Tris, as she led us out of <a data-href="Mosskarm" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/winter/mosskarm.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mosskarm</a> using quieter paths. These were somewhat difficult to traverse, but they provided a beautiful view of the city. Outside, the sky was an indigo blue, lit by thousands of crystals that gave the impression of a night sky, along with an enormous moon that resembled the one from the Material Plane but was twice as large.<br>Approaching the exit, we encountered guards for the first time. They wore masks attached to their helmets and stood motionless, like statues, beside the giant doors that intermittently opened slightly to allow passage.<br>Finally, we stepped out into the cold. I braced myself against the blast of freezing air, a sensation I'd become somewhat familiar with during my time in <a data-href="Nordthorn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/nordthorn/nordthorn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Nordthorn</a>. Tris set a brisk pace, leading us through the vast, pale landscape that made me feel small and brought to mind tales of the Water Plane’s icy expanses.<br>The journey took us three to four hours until we sought refuge inside a hollowed-out snow dome. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mirri" data-href="Mirri" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mirabelle</a> shared the story of her tattoos—ink that appeared one day, making her easier to track — likely linked to her patron, I suspect, whom has been in her life for five decades, apparently.<br>Somehow, I let Mirabelle talk me into trying to woo <a data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Runa</a>. She was not particularly impressed by my attempt and in hindsight, neither am I. Henceforth, I think I’ll leave the wooing up to others.<br>When we resumed our travel from the dome, Tris said we had another hour or two left and warned of a toll we'd have to pay when passing through lands scarred by war, where disturbing the dead was forbidden. In this region, crypts were well-maintained, and the dead were respected equally to the living. Winter here had a deep connection with death, welcoming the undead and honouring <a data-href="The Raven Queen" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/the-raven-queen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">The Raven Queen</a>.<br>Tris led us underground where, inside a cavern, she made a bloody offering to the red fungi – or redcaps, rather, stressing the importance of silence to avoid disturbing them. Mirabelle and I made our own offering, intent on not stirring any trouble unnecessarily.<br>We discovered a shrine illuminated by a massive statue with wings (<a data-href="Faen" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/faen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Faen</a>) and surrounded by nine tombs adorned with symbols of various gods. With some guidance from <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ted</a> and Tris, we learned that the tombs served as markers or memorials for those interred in the ice below.<br>Returning to the surface, we crossed a stream and found a massive hole in the ground (almost reminiscent of the one I found <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Corvaux" data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Varus</a> in mere days ago …), beyond which lay remnants of a camp. Anur suggested setting a trap here and taking a rest while we waited for said trap to be sprung.<br>Tris, before taking her leave, handed Anur a feather from Puck's crest as an identifier to the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Aikling" data-href="Aikling" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Aikling" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aiklings</a> and departed on her own journey.

 <br>Session 16 Day 24? of Bloomweave, year 515 T.A.?<br>
We wrapped things up in the gruesome aftermath of our scuffle with the poachers, with <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaddeus</a> securing the magical pack the dwarven woman used to escape. Exiting the room, we then marched toward the dagger <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Runa" data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Anur</a> is tracking. A split-second action unfolded in the main chamber: someone released a bolt from a crossbow towards Anur, narrowly missing her. The result? Another chaotic bout with poachers singling out <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Corvaux" data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Varus</a> and Anur.<br>During all of that, it took but one spell for the very ground beneath me to soften, leaving a trail of lichen, moss, and fungus marking where I stood ( and stand, still ) — wild magic. The flora spreads the longer I linger in place. I suppose it is better than to be turned green or have my hair transformed into ivy, but I might change my mind about it if it turns out I'll need to hide from something sometime soon. This leaves little to the imagination as to my whereabouts ...<br>But I digress. The skirmish revealed the poachers' vulnerability to silver, much like fiends. Anur struck down the last one wielding a pair of unique daggers, one adamantine and the other enigmatic in its magic. I suppose one of those was the one she was tracking.<br>With <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mirri" data-href="Mirri" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mirabelle</a>'s aid, I frisked the fallen, revealing crossbow bolts, a shortbow, a hand crossbow, and a curious pendant – gold coin pierced through its center, with a worn <a data-href="Asmodeus" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/devils/asmodeus.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Asmodeus</a> stamp on one side. Looting eventually netted us four platinum coins each, 2 of which I've since relinquished to Ted. Speaking of Ted: he, meanwhile, drew us into the cavern's main space, away from the heat of the lava, pointing out a plethora of flying beings, invisible save for his enchanted sight. He sketched their likenesses, the images doing little to ease my discomfort — pixies or nixies likely under hellish influence.<br>Our ensuing rest in the poachers' abandoned camp turned out pensive. Ted circled back to his musings on Asmodeus, which I conceded to the background of my perception as I sought solace in meditation. What catches my ear, though, are warnings: avoid pledging our souls, steer clear of dying on sigils, and don't imbibe blood from altars — lest we forget: souls are the currency of devils.<br>Varus reached a palpable breaking point that took me out of my effort to centre myself, rebuking Ted for entertaining infernal bargains. With fervour, they proclaimed the weight of souls and the gravity of making pacts with devils, not long after which they stormed away in exasperation, leaving the group ( and by <a data-href="Lady Sunnis" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/lady-sunnis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Lady Sunnis</a>, I hope that includes Ted ) to truly consider the potential ( or likely ) ramifications for oneself and the greater world.<br>A warlock-centred discussion then unfolded between Mirabelle and Ted, as it so often does, its intricacies eluding me as I descended back into meditation.<br>Alas, the brief respite shatters as Ted]]'s panic cuts through. His alarm crescendoed with Corvaux's shouting, a harbinger of imminent chaos spilling from the main chamber. Off to greet another potential demise we go.<br>Assuming we survive this, I hereby leave this note to my future self: check in with Anur, now that their hunt is ostensibly concluded.]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-16.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Aerendyl 16.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2024 13:00:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aerendyl 17]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Session 17 Day 24 of Bloomwave, year 515 T.A.?<br>
We rushed into the chamber following <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Corvaux" data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Varus</a>' alarm only to find nothing visible. I tried to investigate but got pulled back quickly by Varus. That's when I felt it—a familiar but unnerving resonance in the air, like when the spirits of the <a data-href="Circle of Seven" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Circle of Seven" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Circle of Seven</a> would return. Yet this was a corruption of those sacred encounters, leaving a sense of violation in its wake.<br>Varus listened closely to the spirit, which repeatedly expressed a desire to be brought to 'my lady,' becoming increasingly agitated. I was intrigued, but sticking around did not seem like the right move, so we made our way topside once more.<br>Once above ground discussing our next move, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ted</a> shared that a fiend had tried to grab <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Obsidian" data-href="Obsidian" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/animal-companions/obsidian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sid</a>, before he quickly summoned them back. Varus was set on eliminating the fiend, but we realized that defeating it there would only be a temporary solution. What's worse, it seems that 'my lady' refers to <a data-href="Zariel" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Zariel" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Zariel</a>, a prominent figure in the <a data-href="blood war" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/blood war" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">blood war</a>, with other unnamed archdevils potentially fitting this descriptor.<br>Our debate on whether to rest at the <a data-href="Crimson Inn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/businesses/crimson-inn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Crimson Inn</a> or march forward was shrouded by the risk of the devil following us, possibly targeting us as 'quality' souls. The threat of deals and the conniving nature of devils lingered in our thoughts.<br>I shared what knowledge I gained from my circle’s the worship of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Dounuma" data-href="Dounuma" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/dounuma.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Dumathoin</a> — how some souls have destinations after death, sorted by <a data-href="The Raven Queen" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/the-raven-queen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">The Raven Queen</a> before possibly being sent to places like the <a data-href="Styx" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Styx" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Styx</a> if promised to a devil.<br>In the end, we chose not to risk any civilians’ safety by returning to the comfortable inn. Instead, we decided to hunt for <a data-href="Vestan Tlanbourn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/vestan-tlanbourn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Vestan Tlanbourn</a>, hopefully aiding both Ted and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mirri" data-href="Mirri" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mirabelle</a>'s quests in that way. Our path seemed to be leading us towards the <a data-href="Autumn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/autumn/autumn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Autumn</a> Court, though how to get there wasn't immediately clear. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Runa" data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Anur</a> and Varus suggested focusing on something specific about the area, like golden oak tree.<br>With concerted focus on golden oak and help from Varus, we navigated towards our elusive destination, passing through a mountainous landscape, eventually witnessing a clear sky filled with vibrant auroras, moons, stars, and even a constellation resembling a unicorn, subtly coming to life when unobserved.<br>Upon finding a cobblestone path by a stream, we stumbled upon a campsite and heard … arguing? Anur fearlessly went ahead to investigate and eventually led us to discover two sprites (pixies? nixies?). and a messenger bag with some items inside – including some expensive wine, apparently. The sprites advised us on who to watch out for and mentioned a village up the mountains ruled by <a data-href="Calisto" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Calisto" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Calisto</a>.<br>Choosing to camp by the river, the weight of Ted's situation became more apparent — he feared that his use of magic was drawing him closer to death, and he did not hold back on emphasising that none of our attempts at offering a solution were insufficient to his mind. I admit that in some type of knee-jerk-like reflex, a part of me grew bitter at the thought of extending my help at all, but another part thought about my dealings with <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Da'yin Kuya of Infinite Facets" data-href="Da'yin Kuya of Infinite Facets" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/da'yin-kuya-of-infinite-facets.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Da'yin Kuya</a> and how deals can consist of a civil conversation and a balanced agreement, not a one-way ticket to demise.<br>Mirabelle proposed to commune with her patron for guidance, offering to prioritize finding Vestan due to their apparent dealings with <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thousand-Eyed Deceiver" data-href="Thousand-Eyed Deceiver" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/demons/thousand-eyed-deceiver.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Zirel</a>.

 <br>[Session 18] Day 25 of Bloomwave, year 515 T.A.?<br>Overnight, I did as I promised: I sought out <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Da'yin Kuya of Infinite Facets" data-href="Da'yin Kuya of Infinite Facets" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/da'yin-kuya-of-infinite-facets.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Da'yin Kuya</a> for the first time since I left  <a data-href="The Sevenfold Maze" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/The Sevenfold Maze" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">The Sevenfold Maze</a> decades ago, and after my arguably messy entry and my adjustment to the immense strangeness of the whole affair, we had a lengthy conversation about what brought me to her to begin with. I spoke one of … <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ted</a>’s patron’s names and, shockingly, found my tongue wagging in tongues I don’t even speak – <a data-href="Abyssal" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/languages/abyssal.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Abyssal</a>, allegedly. Not even Da’yin was left unaffected by it.<br>The main takeaways: the source of Ted’s trouble is Obyrith, an eldritch race of demons, older than even most of the gods. Da'yin  suggested we seek out one of the pools of <a data-href="Meilikki" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/meilikki.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Meilikki</a>, the strongest deity in the <a data-href="Feywild" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Feywild</a>, according to Da'yin ( makes sense ). If he is pure enough of heart, he should be accepted, and come out of it being his truest self.<br>Lastly, on a more personal note, she advised me to lie to some extent ( apparently, it's dangerous to be so honest ), and to be cautious with my words; even a lie, if told often enough, will become true when spoken in the Feywilds. I left with the promise to return when I have news and make more of a habit out of it. I will not wait another three decades to return, at least.<br>Upon coming to, I felt different — something in me had changed… My purpose has shifted, my horizons broadened. I am unsure of the implications, but somehow I seem to feel all the more strongly about what happened once I got out of my hut.<br>As the morning unfolds, Ted sits secluded, holding tightly onto a scroll and a knife, while <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Runa" data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Anur</a> returns from a hunt, presenting a great deer to the camp — clearly successful in her pursuits of the wild game. I felt a bit dishevelled myself, ruminating on the night's encounter with Da'yin, searching for the right words to share with the group.<br>Ted before long revealed that overnight, he negotiated with a devil named <a data-href="Epiphany" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/epiphany.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Epiphany</a> from the infernal realm of <a data-href="Malbolge" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/hell/malbolge.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Malbolge</a>, a prison realm of sorts. His deal allegedly involves gathering three remarkable souls for this devil, using a new ring as a tool. The deal should release him from <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thousand-Eyed Deceiver" data-href="Thousand-Eyed Deceiver" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/demons/thousand-eyed-deceiver.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Zirel</a>'s grasp. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mirri" data-href="Mirri" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mirabelle</a> listens intently, cautioning him against following too closely in the wayward footsteps of <a data-href="Vestan Tlanbourn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/vestan-tlanbourn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Vestan Tlanbourn</a>. <br>I, meanwhile, worry whether this demon will even have the power to undo a pact with something that is more than a mere demon as we know them, per Da'yin's explanation. Ted could not be swayed, however … I suppose all we can do ( now that Ted has left us ) is keep an ear to the ground to hear of any transgressions past the deal he agreed to — and simply hope he will find his precious souls in those who have earned such a … shitty ending.<br>ior. We bicker as usual, of course, but there's a shift in our rapport. Meanwhile, Mirabelle's concern extends to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Corvaux" data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Varus</a>, who's been wrestling with Ted's infernal dealings.<br>With Anur in the lead, we begin our climb up the icy cliffs. I spot a grey-furred tabaxi who seems to be everywhere, raising both curiosity and suspicion.<br>In a clearing, this tabaxi – <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Luck of the Draw" data-href="Luck of the Draw" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Luck</a> by name – greets us with puzzling mutterings and swirling pupils. He's concerned about his shadow and the disfavour of one <a data-href="Ambassador Ushan" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Ambassador Ushan" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ambassador Ushan</a>.<br>Pixies promptly arrive, and <a data-href="Garnet" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Garnet" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Garnet</a>, mounted on a beetle, appears on my shoulder, demanding Luck's teeth or a special gift. I will admit: I was viscerally uncomfortable, and think I spent the majority of the ensuing time either sweating or shivering. <br>Gifts of narration and song were offered, and Anur even surprised us all with her skill on the lyre. With these gifts presented, the pixies departed — but I fear I'll have repercussions to deal with in return for my lack of preparation. I was told, in a whisper I wish to forget as fast as I can, to not "trip on my words next time", before they vanished. My anxiety swelled to the point where I openly sought the comfort of a held hand, wary beyond any measure I've ever felt before.

 <br>Day 25-26 of Bloomweave, year 515 T.A.?<br>
In the presumed safety of our cave, we exchanged names, real and fake, amidst the tension lingering from prior events with the pixies. I felt uneasy, my nerves frazzled, a sensation that muted my voice more than I'd like to admit.<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Luck of the Draw" data-href="Luck of the Draw" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jorinn</a>, whom we'd come to know as Luck of the Draw, admitted once more he had lost count of his time in this place. Having been a merchant back in <a data-href="Sylvari" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/sylvari/sylvari.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sylvari</a>, exile to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Feywild" data-href="Feywild" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">the Feywilds</a> seemed to have stretched long for him. Yet our conversation took turns; he even bested me at arm wrestling — which cost me five gold in the friendly wager.<br>Our dialogue ventured deeper — Jorinn's devotion to the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="The Raven Queen" data-href="The Raven Queen" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/the-raven-queen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Raven Queen</a> lay in the medium of memories, a practice carrying more weight with each recounted past. <a data-href="Ambassador Ushan" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Ambassador Ushan" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ambassador Ushan</a>'s mention brought speculation on the years that had folded since Jorinn had last walked among the <a data-href="Sylvari" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/sylvari/sylvari.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sylvari</a> (300 at worst, apparently?!).<br>Arguably of more interest to myself, though, Jorinn is headed for the <a data-href="Silver Maple" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Silver Maple" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Silver Maple</a>. He even confirmed his task as such must be to deal with the source of the <a data-href="Pale Blight" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/terms-and-phrases/pale-blight.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Pale Blight</a>, alongside various others sent out to what may well be certain death.<br>On first watch with Jorinn, the comfort of the comparatively temperate cold and a secure cave eased the watchful hours. The sky's nocturnal ballet showcased <a data-href="Lucanthus" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Lucanthus" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Lucanthus</a> in its viridescence, a calming contrast to the previous night's capricious display. The occasional sound from outside drew our attention—a branch snapping, a tree falling—but nothing came of it.<br>Jorinn's tale of being ensnared by the pixies in their displeasure painted the forest as an unforgiving loop of traps and deceit. His warning of a potential curse prompted a check of my rations — indeed, I was down to one. In an act of providence, Jorinn went out to forage, and returned with an unexpected feast of bounty.<br>Dawn brought chaos as we clashed with the elusive dwarf that vanished into the pack during our encounter with the poachers. Her fate was bloodily sealed at the end of the skirmish. The issue of the pack persisted, though; <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Runa" data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Anur</a>'s desire to delve into it weighed against <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Mirri" data-href="Mirri" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mirabelle</a>'s insistence on understanding the hunter's narrative.<br>Anur's intent on entering the pack led to a collective decision; ensuring its security demanded creativity. The choice to pursue an animal guardian fell to Jorinn, who returned with an almiraj named <a data-href="Phlip" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Phlip" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Phlip</a>, while I closed the entrance to the cave after patching up Anur (likewise alongside Jorinn). <br>We were prepared to enter whatever lay in the pack stealthily. Anur, in her guise as a fallen enemy, led us in — upon which all of us, save for Anur, were caged upon entering. Her quest for tokens to authorise our release sent her away, leaving us encased and uncertain.<br>The prison's bars were eerily reminiscent of the cold iron found in the <a data-href="Bitter Steppes" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Bitter Steppes" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Bitter Steppes</a> at home, including their anti-magical properties. All we could do as such was wait in lieu of risking a botched attempt at escaping and triggering more alarms ( or worse ), until Anur returned with the means to unshackle us: tokens bearing <a data-href="Asmodeus" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/devils/asmodeus.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Asmodeus</a>' seal, striking deeper questions about our actual location.<br>My best guess to this point is that we're in a demi-plane of some sort. I suspected the <a data-href="Abyss" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/abyss/abyss.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Abyss</a> for a moment, but the sigil anchoring the portal in place simply didn't seem to suggest it. All the same time, knowing the symbol on this seal has everything to do with Asmodeus, still raises questions. This place is called “<a data-href="Dain's Prison" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Dain's Prison" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Dain's Prison</a>” – and by virtue of our last talk with Ted, I recall <a data-href="Glasya" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/devils/glasya.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Glasya</a>, Asmodeus’ daughter, rules the prison plane of the hells (<a data-href="Malbolge" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/hell/malbolge.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Malbolge</a>). What if this “Dain's Prison” is somehow connected to it? Related to it? It is the only way in which the symbols on these tokens make any sense to me.<br>Ah, I digress. We ventured further after a moment, down the stairs, and were greeted by braziers that seemed to conceal more prisons. Lining the walls, tables held both scholarly scrolls and unsettling dissection instruments. Amidst a cold emanating glow, Jorinn's and my attempt to obtain a shard from a peculiar crystal teetered between curiosity and caution—the material's fragility and volatility reminiscent of volatile cold iron.<br>The others already ventured farther down the stairs. Time to follow suit, rather than risk blowing up this place for the sake of a sliver of that cold, glowing crystal …]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-19.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Aerendyl 19.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2024 13:17:18 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aerendyl 20]]></title><description><![CDATA[

For a few moments there, I couldn't help but ponder the relationship between the two, and I was made to think of those whom I went my letters to before we set out for the <a data-href="Feywild" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Feywild</a>.<br>The place prevented us from aiding the stranger, later introduced as <a data-href="Tanis" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/tanis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tanis</a>, with magic, unfortunately, so we resolved to vacate the area post-haste to tend to her ailments properly. The goblin child that lingered in the corner, <a data-href="Jinx" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/jinx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jinx</a>, agreed to join us in our retreat.<br>As we prepared to leave, our conversation turned to <a data-href="Spite" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Spite" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Spite</a>, a tiefling mage apparently all to eager to live up to his name, had stoked in the tower. His 'floor' loomed with ill repute. The stranger tranger led us to a chamber that held a personal artifact – a cord with a pendant – that she swiftly reclaimed.<br>We swiftly left this demi-plane then and, once settled, Luck provided a potion for Tanis in a finely crafted goblet — special in some way, as he insisted it be returned to him after use. News of being in the Feywild startled her, but she swiftly mustered resolve, speaking of acquaintances in the Summer Court we might seek out. Tanis recounted her past — a captain who once stood sentinel against corruption at the <a data-href="Ironwood Citadel" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/sylvari/ironwood-citadel.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ironwood Citadel</a>.<br> Tanis's tale unfolded as she wrapped herself in Runa's bedroll, managing her own care while <a data-href="Mirri" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mirri</a> divulged her pursuit of <a data-href="Vestan Tlanbourn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/vestan-tlanbourn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Vestan Tlanbourn</a> in time — a name Tanis recognized with a scowl. <br>The discourse darkened further when hellfire weaponry and their devastating potential were brought forth by Mirri, who apparently found some in the unnamed demi-plane we just left (I still suspect it is somehow tied to <a data-href="Malbolge" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/hell/malbolge.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Malbolge</a> …). The weapons' power to sunder reality itself brought forth an inevitable discussion as to what next to do with the pack. We debated its fate, ultimately deciding to contain its threat within <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a>'s own enchanted bag for the time being. Despite the risk, Corvaux, took the decisive step, leaving us startled, but unscathed.<br>With preparations complete, we departed from our temporary cave haven, but not without another encounter with the whimsical pixies.

<a data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Runa</a> left overnight, and that took us all by surprise – though I get the impression I’m the only one that needs a moment to actually process it. She left behind only a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Runa > Departure" data-href="Runa#Departure" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html#Departure" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">note</a> telling us not to follow and a poem, which seemed entirely unlike her, but, on the other hand, it just goes to show how little I knew about her.<br>In a way, it makes sense. She seemed annoyed by us more often than not, or at the very least aloof. I know for one I’m the one that gets attached far too easily — give me twenty-four hours at someone’s side, and if there’s no instant ill fit to speak of, I’ll wind up all too invested. She seemed the polar opposite. I would’ve liked to see what lay beyond that reserved nature of hers, but … well, that’ll just be another of those what-ifs, I suppose.<br>I didn’t have much time to process once I got up in the morning. It unveiled the first sunrise I've witnessed in far too many days. Seeing it at last, I felt a wave of something akin to relief.<br>Setting forth after spending some time occupied by <a data-href="Grout" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Grout" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Grout</a>, <a data-href="Golden Oak" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Golden Oak" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Golden Oak</a> was the direction we were to go in, though the road there was said to be home to a wailing witch, and was described as a necropolis of sorts.

Maybe I’ll take charge next time …<br>Either way, at length we reached a temple of the<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="The Raven Queen" data-href="The Raven Queen" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/the-raven-queen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Raven Queen</a> by a cliff within a colourful, marshy part of the forest. I was taken by the beauty of the surroundings — trees adorned with colours that seemed painted by light. It was [Mirri]]'s keen eye that caught the the sound of a lone figure playing the lute, her chords striking an unnerving resonance.<br>Approaching the bard, later revealed to be named <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Deidre" data-href="Deidre" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/deidre.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Deidre</a>, she confessed to being trapped here and requested our help. It wasn’t too difficult to surmise, then, that this was the wailing witch we were warned of. Either way, she sketched a dire situation in vague details — jailers donning animal masks, leaving behind a fog over her memory.<br>Interestingly, she also read <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a>'s inked skin, identifying the markings as anchors of her roguish skills of sorts. She also seemed to grow anxious at Grout's presence. Afraid of canines ..?<br>Our resolve to help notwithstanding, we first entered a nearby temple dedicated to the Raven Queen, a place of memory and exchange revealed itself. While some offerings were made to the Raven Queen by those dedicated to her, I joined Mirri outside.<br>I gave her the  moss I’d picked up some days ago ( writing this down so I don't wind up wondering where I left it! ), so she could exchange it for a Rowan stick on the ground. She explained it possessed magical protective qualities: it keeps internal magic in, and external magic out through a magical absorption sort of property. She intends to use the stick to work on something that might give her a bit of an edge — in the fight with <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Vestan Tlanbourn" data-href="Vestan Tlanbourn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/vestan-tlanbourn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tlanbourn</a> to come, I suppose?<br>As we set off towards our new objective ( the mansion Deidre is apparently tied to ), Corvaux soon sensed an ominous surveillance and before long, we found ourselves hidden atop a ridge, ready to thwart danger that loomed from the shadows.<br>The confrontation was sudden — a shadowy assailant attacking Corvaux. It began as a hidden strike but quickly escalated into open combat, with the entire group defending against the encroaching threat.]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-24.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Aerendyl 24.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2024 13:24:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aerendyl 25]]></title><description><![CDATA[

After the battle, <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Deidre" data-href="Deidre" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/deidre.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Deidre</a> explored the fallen tree where it all began. The tree bristled with an unseen force, and though my companions were out of sight, Corvaux soon returned with filigree weapons from the entangled bodies within its roots. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Luck of the Draw" data-href="Luck of the Draw" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Luck</a> surmised they were likely the possessions of guards. Meanwhile, Deidre had run off and scurried back; the distance from the manor seemed to wear on her. She implored us to assist her in breaking the curse anchoring her to the mansion soon.<br>On the journey back, my gaze fell upon the younger trees. I recognized where old trees had once stood, their absence marking decades passed. We reached the mansion built upon ancient roots, deciding to pause for understanding before entering the dark spellwork that bound Deidre.<br>We scoured the first floor to no avail and then ascended. The balcony greeted us with paint stains, investigated and tasted by Corvaux. An intricate door bore sinister red runes, while a stone sigil whisked me back in time to a memory with Bell, a pair of cultists, and summoning circles.<br>The broken sigil captured my attention; I dedicated an hour to unravel its secrets, imagining its origins and destinations. The others, meanwhile, ventured into the sigil-guarded room as a haunting and beautiful tone enveloped me—the song of a star, a melody <a data-href="Wisp" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/wisp.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Wisp</a> had alluded to, unheard of in <a data-href="Autumn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/autumn/autumn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Autumn</a>. Time to put that sending stone to work once I have a moment.<br>I followed inside at length, found myself … welcomed by a wink from Deidre, and then … I don't know just what came over me, but I followed her as she ventured into another room. I won't get into unnecessarily embarrassing details, but it turned out I followed her right to the threshold of her bedroom. Scratched out self-deprecation here!!!<br>We parted ways and I trekked upstairs. entering there a chamber enshrouded in webs, where Luck identified a simple cat amidst the gossamer threads. Now, I'm not afraid of spiders, but I'd like to be able to see them and not be caught off-guard by them. So, do I trust these webs? No, not quite.<br>Anyway, <a data-href="Mirri" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mirri</a> stood fixated on a sizable egg—a dragon's egg she was keen to pilfer for future profit. I wish she wouldn't, especially after hearing Luck break … whatever he broke in an adjacent room. Whether Deidre was bound here by force or not, this is her home, right? Why rob her when we promised her our help? I find it all a troubling … lack of respect. Perhaps I ought to speak up before the day is over. Who knows what mischief a short trance will allow Mirri to get up to well before I've awoken after a night's rest!<br>The nearby books narrated tales of dragons, and before us was a statue, a jade wyrmling at rest.

 <br>Day 28/29 of Bloomweave, 515 T.A.?<br>
In the quiet hours before we sought out our bedrolls, I reached out to <a data-href="Wisp" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/wisp.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Wisp</a> with the sending stone, discussing the peculiar sound haunting my thoughts. Wisp confirmed it was related to the star she could hear, and, since the <a data-href="Crimson Gaze" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/factions/crimson-gaze.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Crimson Gaze</a> is departing in two days, asked if I could trace the sound to its source before then—two days! How am I to even do that? It lingers as an unsettling challenge even now—cross-planar communication holds a sliver of uncertainty, after all, and I don’t expect the Crimson Gaze to hang around in the <a data-href="Feywild" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Feywild</a> after departing.<br>The next morning, I got to wondering whether something's wrong with <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a>—not in the offensive sense, but she's been sleeping; dreaming, even, instead of going into a trance. I wonder to what end she's doing that, but I haven't the heart to pry.<br>Instead, I asked <a data-href="Mirri" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mirri</a> not to indulge further in theft while she pored through a massive tome, urging some respect toward Deidre's home. Yet as words faltered, I found Mirri unmoved—and, somewhat comically, the egg she pilfered missing from her possession. I got the impression she blamed me for it …<br>Oh, well.  Maybe <a data-href="Grout" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Grout" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Grout</a> or <a data-href="Ralph" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/animal-companions/ralph.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ralph</a> got their sticky little paws on it. In any case, Corvaux and I headed off to prepare tea for the group atop glowing coals, which is when we stumbled upon symbols amongst the wood—a death's-head moth and a rough diamond, the latter which was especially familiar to me as a symbol of <a data-href="Dounuma" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/dounuma.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Dounuma</a>'s (or Dumathoin, if you will). A conversation with <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Deidre" data-href="Deidre" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/deidre.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Deidre</a> about such ominous icons is due at some point, but we had more pressing matters to resolve, first.<br>Together, Corvaux and I sought Deidre, where I clumsily offered tea, only to witness it discarded with nonchalance—an embarrassing testament to our different tastes, I suppose. We apologised for Mirri's pilfering. In retrospect, I'm relieved she wasn't there to hear it. I fear she'd have struck us both upside the head with a well-aimed Eldritch Blast in retaliation for speaking on her behalf.<br>Before long, our ensemble convened to devise a plan. The vault beneath the manor most likely contained the heart of the curse. Deidre recounted a symbol to beware of—a symbol eerily familiar the several I've found in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Malachi" data-href="Malachi" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/malachi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">the Stonecutter</a>'s journal.<br>decided to reveal the contents of the journal to the group—not just one person; not just to Corvaux as I did before, but everyone. The depth of the Stonecutter's work startled both Mirri and me with its potency, detailing entities known for pilfering souls, evoking the name of the dreaded <a data-href="Orcus" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/demons/orcus.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Orcus</a>, and a record narrating an inquiry into the lineage and purpose of missing souls. The symbols somehow seemed to depict anchors of such souls, in a sense?<br>Mirri stressed the power described in just these few pages, warning that it must never fall into <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Vestan Tlanbourn" data-href="Vestan Tlanbourn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/vestan-tlanbourn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tlanbourn</a>'s hands. In fact, she would sooner set the journal and myself on fire than let that happen. She would have to; my resolve to hang onto these wretched pages and follow them to my destination is stronger now than ever before. I'll not give this up willingly.<br>Based on these findings, though, I theorized the circular symbols Deidre sketched out might just be what's anchoring her here—her soul, specifically. Depending on the exact state of the symbol, we might need to destroy it, or dismantle it by tampering with the Weave that powers it. It'll be tricky nonetheless, I expect.<br>So we traversed to the basement, Ralph and Grout left above to avoid harm. We found the entry sealed, but with Corvaux's touch, the stone slid away, revealing the steps into depths gilded as solid gold. Below, statues and a white bowl before a lit effigy of Lord <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Eristalon" data-href="Eristalon" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/eristalon.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aurelius</a> (or Eristalon, as we've come to know the name) beckoned for an offering. Deidre's wooden wolf idol granted us passage. <br>In the next chamber, a grand harp stood amid silence, and we discovered a sigil requiring a key—the solution lay within a treasury that awoke armoured assailants as Corvaux and Mirri crossed its threshold. After a scuffle, we claimed the gold and gems inside, aquamarine crystals particularly catching my eye—a near sacred piece of my homeland.<br>Mirri's critique of my fascination with the gems sparked bitterness; I felt the chasm my earlier request might have given way to, widen. Nonetheless, we affirmed the spoils were not Deidre's to start with (so I assume they belonged to this Eristalon), and divided them fairly amongst all of us. In hindsight, I wonder what might become of us if he ever finds out what we took from his treasury …<br>With this chamber practically emptied, a secret chamber revealed itself, one that turned our stomachs with decay and one that encompassed something other than golden, shiny wealth—organs, daggers, and the lingering questions that now we must still answer.]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-26.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Aerendyl 26.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2024 13:25:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aerendyl 27]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br> Day 29 of Bloomweave, 515 T.A.?<br>
Today's explorations in the manor's depths proved both wondrous and unsettling. As I examined the crystals and amber adorning the central table, <a data-href="Deidre" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/deidre.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Deidre</a> donned a thorny crown, much to <a data-href="Mirri" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mirri</a>'s chagrin. <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> sensed hidden magic within it, piquing our curiosity. Another crown similarly held promise of some magic potency—something that would turn "if looks could kill" into reality, I believe?<br>I admittedly found myself somewhat distracted during the explanation, for amidst the gems on the centre table was a piece of amber, flawlessly cut, with a small acorn suspended inside, glowing with a golden aura. Corvaux handed it to me, and I was transported back to my journey to <a data-href="Rakāuvi" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/rakāuvi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Rakāuvi</a>, to a tale an old man spun about <a data-href="Silvanus" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/silvanus.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Silvanus</a>.<br>Deep in a forest far to the south-west of Rakāuvi, lies a tree where Silvanus slumbers. When he stirs, roused by anger, the tree drops golden acorns imbued with the power to cheat death itself. A seed of resurrection, forever tied to his resting place. We agreed to safeguard this treasure, should dire need arise—even if death, indeed, is a natural part of life. I won't have us lightly use such an item as such.<br>My attention then turned to a tome sealed within a blue dome—the Dendritic Grimorium. Its pages no doubt held forbidden secrets of controlling plants and forging unnatural connections, echoing <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaddeus</a>' interest in the murals about bringing stone to life; turning it sentient. When I queried Mirri about her own research, her curt dismissal left me bristling. Her apparent bitterness hung like a shroud I could not pierce.<br>As we paused near the coffins, an unseen force intervened. From my pack tumbled a glass eye, its gaze fixed unerringly upon me. Panic gripped my heart—it seems a hag named <a data-href="Sabina" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Sabina" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sabina</a>, spurned by Deidre, is now watching my every step. This must be those scratched out pixies’ doing. Oh, I do so treasure the variety of life—but I will be the first to admit there is no love lost between myself and them. Either way, I hastily buried the eye deep in my belongings, where it must have spent the past few days, praying it would bring no further misfortune to my companions until we have a moment to address the matter properly.<br>We had a task to complete first, after all. We returned to the locked door in the first chamber, which after some trial and error, Corvaux managed to unlock, permitting us to pass farther below ground. Here, we encountered a sprawling sigil scrawled in myriad tongues—<a data-href="Abyssal" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/languages/abyssal.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Abyssal</a>, <a data-href="Druidic" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Druidic" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Druidic</a>, <a data-href="Sylvan" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/languages/sylvan.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sylvan</a>. Mirri understood the grand majority of what was written there; I needed only pitch in to help her decipher the Druidic, which seemed … strangely off-beat.<br>Her sudden demand for privacy between herself and Deidre caught me off guard. Reluctantly, I followed Corvaux and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Luck of the Draw" data-href="Luck of the Draw" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Luck</a>, my heart heavy with worry for Deidre and frustration at my own impotence.<br>Relief washed over me when they both returned, seemingly unharmed, with Deidre proclaiming her newfound freedom. But a new mission called—the remains of <a data-href="Kai" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Kai" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Kai</a>, her ghostly friend, awaited recovery.<br>A small jaunt later, we found ourselves in what felt like catacombs of sorts—the walls set with bones, skeletons suspended from chains, and coffins smattered about an off-shoot of the main chamber. Urgency seized Corvaux as she plunged into the well at the centre before long … with <a data-href="the Stonecutter" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/the Stonecutter" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">the Stonecutter</a>'s journal in her pack. Without hesitation, I went after her alongside Mirri, Deidre, and Luck.<br>As we sank deeper, the sound <a data-href="Wisp" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/wisp.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Wisp</a> foretold grew ever louder in my mind, its call unmistakable…]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/aerendyl-27.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Aerendyl 27.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2024 13:25:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Corvaux 25]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>The following log is written in an old style of Elvish<br>
Day: Unknown | Location: Feywild<br>Normally I wouldn't write things down, but I feel like I need to. First <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaddeus</a> left, and now <a data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Runa</a>. It's understandable. It's a shame that I wasn't able to ask her questions about her relationship to <a data-href="Yewdon" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/yewdon/yewdon.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Yewdon</a> before she left like I meant to. I wanted to ask if she knew anyone who went in, if maybe I knew anyone that she knew so I could give information on them. That's on me for being too slow, I suppose. I can only hope that we meet again in the future so I can ask, though I fear that her return to the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Ironwood Citadel" data-href="Ironwood Citadel" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/sylvari/ironwood-citadel.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Citadel</a>, especially when she has the knowledge that I and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Pale Blight" data-href="Pale Blight" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/terms-and-phrases/pale-blight.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">the Blight</a> have escaped Yewdon, is dangerous information that puts me at risk. And yet, that isn't what bothers me most. What bothers me most there is heavy scribbling over the next few lines, as Corvaux wrote down their feelings and promptly decided that it was too much<br>We moved on. On our way, we came across a shrine of the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="The Raven Queen" data-href="The Raven Queen" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/the-raven-queen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Raven Queen</a>. An unexpected find, though <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Luck of the Draw" data-href="Luck of the Draw" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Luck</a> appeared to be happy about it. Hopefully he can get whatever guidance or answers he wants from those within, of which there were three. The place doesn't feel right to me, though I imagine the cause of that is the usual personal problem when it comes to places of worship.<br>We also met a strange individual at the shrine. <a data-href="Deidre" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/deidre.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Deidre</a>, an elven individual who unsettled me with how... I'm not sure how to word it. It's certainly not familiarity, it can't be. Though she recognised my markings? And suggested that they may be connected to my "inherent stealthiness" as I am loathe to call it. I wish I had better words for whatever the fuck is wrong with me, no matter how beneficial it is. Regardless, Deidre needed help, and I am certainly not against releasing a woman who was trapped against her will.<br>Further on, we found a place that Luck had been directed to for an errand. But it felt wrong. It felt like home. And still I foolishly investigated the fallen tree despite my warnings. I knew it was foolish. Nothing good comes from that which reminds me of home.<br>Since when did the shadows become attackers in their own right? I'd better survive this.

Day: No clue, I lost count and that mountain might've been a time loop.<br># FREEDOM!<br>I have no clue how long I have been wandering the same gods forsaken parts of this forest and mountain. When I first appeared in Winter there was sun, and I tried to go through the <a data-href="Krumholtz Mountains" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Krumholtz Mountains" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Krumholtz Mountains</a> in what felt like a couple months after that. Stopped counting a long time ago, but the sun isn't here anymore just the moon. I ran into a pair of fey, and I tried to pull my usual routine on them when they asked for a gift. I found a small painting of an elf, and it was the closest thing in my pack I thought worked as a gift. I don't even remember what I said, something about it belonging to a lord. The pixies said I could pass, but the pixies lied!! I was grabbed maybe a few hours later, left hanging upside down in a rope trap. They told me it was "too boring" and something about teeth??? I tried telling them I had a better gift but they would not hear my pleas and left me there. <br>Theres no other word for my experience except torture, I would be left in some manner of trap for sometimes days at a time. I had enough survival experience to find my own food and water, but when the trap would release almost all of the food or water would be sabotaged. Pebbles in all the mushrooms, every animal scared off, I would try and boil drinking water from the snow but if I ever looked away for even a moment it would be knocked over or have salt poured in. I've learned how to not blink for at least 10 minute intervals while the water boils despite the harsh and cold winds just so I could consistently get safe drinking water. When I would rest, the best I could expect is to wake with pine needles in my ears and nose, sometimes poison ivy or similar. Don't even get me started on the singing, even now I swear I can still hear it. After a while of this, or if I got too comfortable, I was put back into another trap so the cycle could start all over again.<br>But finally after only gods know how long, some travelers seeking to journey past Krumholtz Mountains appeared. I wasn't really paying attention at first, normally I am very perceptive but however long I have been in this cycle I've never spotted a single animal or other living thing besides those pixies and the plant life. I got used to not really needing to keep an ear out. When they got very close, and I finally noticed the sound of crunching snow barely a few feet from me, I jumped a little bit. I surely looked and sounded crazy, I might be just a little crazy. I mean what other kind of person has to keep an eye on their shadow?<br>At first I thought them some new trick, something to spice up the entertainment I was bringing the pixies. Or maybe the pixies were still angry with the threats I made and brought people to hurt me, the largest of the group certainly looked like they could. Never again am I threatening a fey I can't beat. But no, just travelers like I was who must now bring a gift so they can pass. Some fine gifts, stories, performances, these pixies had a particular interest in either teeth or disturbing events.<br>Had I known ages ago that is what made for a good gift to these pixies, I would've never been trapped on this mountain. Early into my banishment to Winter but after the moon replaced the sun I fought off an ogre and pulled its tooth out. I couldn't really say why I chose to do it, but I carved the word "moon" into the tooth. But, I do want to remember my hardships. In no shape or form does this punishment fit the crime and unless the coward died first, <a data-href="Ambassador Ushan" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Ambassador Ushan" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ambassador Ushan</a> hasn't seen the last of me. I gifted the tooth to the pixies, the quiet one was very quick to snatch it from me. Then, finally, I was free to leave this mountain. <br>I chose to follow those Travelers as they marched onward, they're headed to one of the other courts, following a vision in their minds of <a data-href="Golden Oak" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Golden Oak" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Golden Oak</a>. While I have never left Winter, I figured I could surely at least aid them in the journey, after all I didn't learn nothing from my time in Winter. They accepted, thank the gods. We're resting in a cave now having just gotten a glimpse of the sun. I think I will stick with these people, at the very least until we've left the feywilds. I wonder how much time has actually passed? I wonder if I actually remember when in the hells I even got banished.]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/luck-of-the-draw-18.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Luck of the Draw 18.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2024 13:26:51 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Luck of the Draw 19]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Day: Anywhere between 100-300 years, apparently<br>My senses are slowly returning to me, though I'm still in a bit of a elated state finally free of that same repeating patch of wood and mountain. My second conversation in who knows how long went not as bad as it could have. I don't think I made a bad impression of myself anyway. Better than my first with this group, I'm sure to regain my charm in time.. if said charm still applies to this day and age?<br>Apparently, based solely on <a data-href="Mirri" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mirri</a>'s memory of <a data-href="Ambassador Ushan" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Ambassador Ushan" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ambassador Ushan</a>, it could have been as long as 300 years since my banishment to Winter. My thoughts immediately go to my family in <a data-href="Baheera" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/baheera/baheera.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Baheera</a>, even in the ideal scenario of roughly a 100 years its unlikely anyone I knew is still alive. I hope the <a data-href="Angel's Share" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Angel's Share" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Angel's Share</a> is doing well regardless, if they're still in business I have at least a centuries worth of donations to catch up on. I must keep moving forward however, theres still every chance I die in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Feywild" data-href="Feywild" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">the Feywilds</a> and nothing occurring in <a data-href="Rakāuvi" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/rakāuvi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Rakāuvi</a> matters unless I can get there alive. <br>Following that I had an amusing arm wrestling contest with <a data-href="Mirri" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mirri</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Aerendyl" data-href="Aerendyl" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/aerendyl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aeren</a>, I hadn't expected to win really but it was nice levity. I also learned that I have some like-minded companions in this party, improves the odds I'll try and stick with them after we make it out of the Feywilds. Mirri especially, they seemed very excited to meet a fellow charlatan. <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> had a connection with the demon influence in <a data-href="Silver Maple" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Silver Maple" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Silver Maple</a>, in the Autumn court. So we found rapport, or I hope we did, in my mission to deal with that demonic influence. Corvaux described a "<a data-href="Pale Blight" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/terms-and-phrases/pale-blight.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Pale Blight</a>" that I should take extreme caution in facing, though they also said trying would be foolish so I'm having trouble telling where I stand with them.<br>Further interesting me in sticking with this group, apparently they're interesting enough to have people attempting to assassinate them in the dead of "night". <a data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Runa</a>, a very large and intimidating member of this party, was attacked by some devil worshipping poacher with a paralytic poison. They had apparently fought a group of these before meeting me, a shame I wasn't there for it it would have been quite the memory. The assassin was fought off quickly, I managed the killing blow but truly Runa was more than tough enough to have done that themselves. <br>Runa figured that the assassin appeared in camp thanks to a magic bag they took from them earlier. There was some brief discourse between Runa and the group, the rest trying to learn more about why Runa was after these poachers in the first place. Eventually though it was settled we would see where this bag leads, try and deal with whatever or whoever's on the other side. The cave was sealed by Aeren, and a number of spells cast in preparation, that were unfortunately wasted as all of us but a now magically disguised Runa were sent directly to magic dampening cells.<br>Runa, through I can only assume was clever deception, got past a little girl that was in the other room and recognized who Runa was disguised as. After writing our names into a book and giving us each tokens stamped with the symbol of <a data-href="Asmodeus" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/devils/asmodeus.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Asmodeus</a>, something that I picked up must've had prior meaning to this group in addition to the devil worshippers here, we were able to walk free of our cells and explore what a disembodied voice explained to us was "<a data-href="Dain's Prison" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Dain's Prison" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Dain's Prison</a>" and a demiplane. <br>As a sign off, I'm trying to steal a cold stone/gem/whatever that these people were using as a part of their cooler. Apparently it might explode if I try and chip pieces off, dying in a freezer is probably near the bottom of my desired ways to kick the bucket so I'll just stick to stealing the food if I can't get the rock.]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/luck-of-the-draw-19.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Luck of the Draw 19.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2024 13:29:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Luck of the Draw 23]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Property of Luck<br>
Day: Roughly 309 years (no wonder my back aches I'm 335 years old)<br>Ive done some more traveling with this group, and I have only become further convinced I would like to continue traveling with this group as I work on rebuilding my reputation and legacy, not that I had much of either before. Our journey has taken us to the <a data-href="Scarlet City" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Scarlet City" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Scarlet City</a>, finally beyond the <a data-href="Krumholtz Mountains" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Krumholtz Mountains" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Krumholtz Mountains</a> and very near the <a data-href="Autumn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/autumn/autumn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Autumn</a> border. To sort of catch us up on entries Ive missed, <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> had caught a disease of some kind interacting with a portal to the Abyss when they were still on the material, we have plans on journeying to <a data-href="Silver Maple" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Silver Maple" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Silver Maple</a> and dealing with the pale blight, we went aboard the <a data-href="Crimson Gaze" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/factions/crimson-gaze.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Crimson Gaze</a> to party, fight, drink, and get our fortunes read, I ended up learning exactly how long Ive been away by talking with the crew. Beyond that, mostly shopping for silver, pale blight protection, and my brand new companion <a data-href="Ralph" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/animal-companions/ralph.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ralph</a> an absolutely beautiful moorbounder that doesn't like to stay still or move from my side.<br>The previous night, after our party on the Crimson Gaze, I had gotten my first talk with <a data-href="Crowley" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Crowley" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Crowley</a> in quite some time. I haven't just yet explained Crowley to the party, I can't really think how to word that I have a red eyed crowlock visitor in my dreams that gives me information. Not without sounding a little crazy, though it's potentially nowhere near as alarming to this particular group as it would be for anyone else. Crowley in their typical slightly disjointed fashion informed me it was still very necessary to head to Silver Maple, two demon presences were still around, they also mentioned something about siblings that I assumed was not being literal and just referencing that others like myself were sent. Crowley also made it clear to bring silver, holy water, and plenty of food which we were able to find in spades while shopping in the Scarlet City. Well except the food, I may just gather or hunt it myself.<br>While shopping I met <a data-href="Josiah" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/josiah.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Josiah</a>, a merchant within the city, who had on offer a periapt that could significantly protect Ralph from the <a data-href="Pale Blight" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/terms-and-phrases/pale-blight.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Pale Blight</a>. It was very expensive and after all the shopping I was all but broke, so instead I offered up ranger services and have received a list of items to collect for a discount on a future item purchase. Hopefully I can gather the gold and items to be able to afford that periapt for Ralph, his safety has quickly rose to the top of my priorities. To that end, <a data-href="Mirri" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mirri</a> has made a deal with me for the shards and powder of Flail Snail eggs she had, and I ventured north with Ralph and Corvaux to find some other items. We ended up discovering a cave leading to a Frost Salamander colony where using some rabbits I caught, a nearby tree, and rope, I had set up a simple snare trap to try and get some of the frost salamanders teeth without too taxing of a fight.<br>
Im writing this section while we wait for a salamander to get stuck in the trap, will update after the fight.<br>Update: It immediately went wrong. First of all it was MASSIVE I knew some surface level knowledge but I certainly wasn't expecting an ice breathing lizard the size of two or three moorbounders put together. Ralph had to pull out of the fight almost immediately, I spent a considerable amount of time just trying to keep them standing and taking mostly missed shots on the salamander with my bow. Corvaux thankfully is an extremely capable fighter, they handled the fight almost single-handedly. In a moment of shock and terror Ralph went down from the salamanders frost breath but I was able to heal them with my slumbering dragon vessel. Basically the only reason we survived is because my trap managed to hold the entire time, though Corvaux might've somehow won regardless given how much damage they dealt.<br>In the end, we got out of it with three of the salamanders teeth, Corvaux didn't really get anything out of this fight though so I should figure out some way to repay them for the help, it wouldn't have been possible without them after all. I've also decided <a data-href="Ralph" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/animal-companions/ralph.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ralph</a> simply won't be aiding in future combats, I can train them as a hunting/scouting companion instead of a battle one so they never get that close to death again. Frankly I'm a bit ashamed of how little help I was on the martial front of that fight, I need to be so much stronger than I currently am. We're resting for the night in the city and I believe we're headed to Autumn next. Very excited to finally be out of Winter after so long.<br>Note to self: Absolutely NEVER sell that slumbering dragon vessel, <a data-href="Ralph" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/animal-companions/ralph.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ralph</a> would have died without it.]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/luck-of-the-draw-23.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Luck of the Draw 23.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2024 13:30:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Luck of the Draw 24]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Day: Not just yet, almost?<br>Upon waking we were greeted to <a data-href="Mirri" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mirri</a> explaining <a data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Runa</a> has left, leaving a <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Runa > Departure" data-href="Runa#Departure" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html#Departure" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">note</a> behind that they have left to the <a data-href="Ironwood Citadel" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/sylvari/ironwood-citadel.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ironwood Citadel</a>. Some of the others were a bit disheartened at this news but truly I barely knew them, I hope I didn't come off as too cold about the situation.<br>We're headed into <a data-href="Autumn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/autumn/autumn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Autumn</a> to a place called the <a data-href="Fallen Halls" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Fallen Halls" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Fallen Halls</a>, I took the opportunity to guide the party toward "<a data-href="Golden Oak" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Golden Oak" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Golden Oak</a>"  the last time I stepped foot in a court besides <a data-href="Winter" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/winter/winter.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Winter</a> I was still a merchant traveling the roads of <a data-href="Sylvari" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/sylvari/sylvari.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sylvari</a> so my sense of paths and other more comfortable ways of traveling were at best minimal and more likely non-existent. Despite that we did all make our way forward, finding ourselves in front of a shrine to the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="The Raven Queen" data-href="The Raven Queen" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/the-raven-queen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Raven Queen</a>.<br>There was also the sound of a lute playing a strange haunting song, the source of which was someone with Elvish features named <a data-href="Deidre" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/deidre.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Deidre</a>. Initially I felt that she spoke like a liar, or like someone who wanted something, I haven't met many who would offer so many compliments and not have ulterior motives. Perhaps I was getting the wrong idea from them but despite how they acted they were still asking for our help, something I wasn't going to walk away from. Apparently a group of masked people had somehow bound her to the area, specifically a mansion around here. Where we found her was roughly as far as she could go. When I asked why the only reason she gave was that they wanted her talents as a bard.<br>I asked that I get a brief moment in the shrine before leaving to help Deidre. I wasn't actually expecting others to already be inside, other worshippers for the Raven Queen. Deidre had mentioned she would visit the shrine often as well, though I don't believe she is an actual devotee. I took the opportunity to speak with one of the three tending to the shrine, ensure that I was worshipping the Raven Queen properly and to learn how I might better serve them. I even wish to move forward as one of their clerics if I can.<br>After that brief discussion, I was informed of a worshipper who was meant to collect offerings near a fallen but still living tree that had not returned with those items. I agreed to retrieve those items, made my own offerings of items I collected in Winter to the shrine, then headed out to find those offerings and help Deidre. <br>We have approached the fallen tree, and <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> warned us of danger, Deidre vanished with invisibility and Corvaux is approaching the tree. I stand ready with my bow sensing that this will almost certainly break out into combat.]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/luck-of-the-draw-24.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Luck of the Draw 24.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2024 13:30:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mirri 0.5]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>20th of Bloomweave, 515 of 3A.<br>A friend in the Guild tipped me off—someone matching <a data-href="Vestan Tlanbourn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/vestan-tlanbourn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Vestan Tlanbourn</a>'s description was seen near Jasmine’s Cliff with three others. My friend tailed them until they disappeared into the woods. Note to self: I owe them a drink.<br>
I set out immediately and ran into two others on the road to the <a data-href="Felderwisp Farm" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Felderwisp Farm" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Felderwisp Farm</a>—a cleric and a warrior. They made horrendous noise, all heavy armor and chainmail, so I slipped off on my own to get a better vantage point. My two “companions” made their way into the farm cabin, taking on the two guards, and I seized my chance to slip upstairs and corner whoever was waiting up there. I Charmed him and finally, after all of these years, got some answers: he was communing with someone named <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thousand-Eyed Deceiver" data-href="Thousand-Eyed Deceiver" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/demons/thousand-eyed-deceiver.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Zirel</a> in a place called the <a data-href="Fallen Halls of Eristalon" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Fallen Halls of Eristalon" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Fallen Halls of Eristalon</a>.<br>
The cleric, <a data-href="Halek" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Halek" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Halek</a>, was looking for a girl, the daughter of the farmers who lived here, whose blood coated the walls of their home. The half-orc was against me killing the cultists outright, as if they deserved any sort of mercy. Regardless, I stripped them bare and pocketed their daggers to sell later. I may not have been allowed to slit their throats, but I could, at least, humiliate them. From there, we headed to the barn, where I found a tiefling and a strange elf in a cage. I cleaved the tiefling’s mind in two with Dissonant Whispers and we managed to free the caged man, <a data-href="Malachi" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/malachi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Malachi</a>.<br>He knew the bastard’s name! He said he had last seen him in the <a data-href="Straterra University" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Straterra University" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Straterra University</a> in<a data-href="Sandfall City" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/earth-plane-(elemental)/sandfall-city.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sandfall City</a> on the <a data-href="Earth Plane" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/earth-plane-(elemental)/earth-plane.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Earth Plane</a>. Finally! A lead!<br>
In a shrine on the property, we found the child, <a data-href="Nettie" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Nettie" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Nettie</a>. The half-orc, <a data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Runa</a>, comforted the child with the scrappy Tressym kitten she’d found in the barn. Nettie is a brave child, but gods know she shouldn’t have to be. She should never have had to endure this. No one should. She will be safe in the city, at least, and the local clerics can seal the rift to the Abyss here. It was open to the 108th layer… add that to my research list for when I next find a library.<br>
Halek and I spoke about what I had learned from the cultist and he offered to send myself and my new… friend, Runa, to an Archive, where we might find someone who can help, someone who knows how I can get to that university. Here’s hoping, at least.<br>[Below are two small sketches: one of the cage that Malachi (sic) was placed in, and the other of Runa's Tressym.]<br><img alt="20th_Bloomweave_p2.jpg" src="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/lib/media/20th_bloomweave_p2.jpg">]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/mirri-0.5.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Mirri 0.5.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 16:59:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/lib/media/20th_bloomweave_p2.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/lib/media/20th_bloomweave_p2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mirri 11]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Session 12 and 13<br>
23rd of Bloomweave, (Maybe?) 515 of 3A.<br>
Day 1 in the Feywilds<br>  I’m in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Feywild" data-href="Feywild" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">the Feywilds</a>! The last time I thought about this place was when I was a girl, listening to stories Mama told me of the Ni’Tessine summer home in <a data-href="Melianmar" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Melianmar" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Melianmar</a>, of visiting Eladrin and the long nights of dancing. But Melianmar is tied to the <a data-href="Summer" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/summer/summer.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Summer</a> Court, and I’m here in <a data-href="Winter" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/winter/winter.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Winter</a>.<br>
Which means we should be careful. I’ve gone with the Sunstar alias, and my companions have all chosen one as well: <a data-href="Aerendyl" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/aerendyl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aerendyl</a> is Kohatu, <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> is Varus, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaddeus</a> is Ted Barney, and <a data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Runa</a> is Anur.<br>
Corvaux had a bit of an… episode when we first arrived in <a data-href="Mosskarm" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/winter/mosskarm.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mosskarm</a>, mistaking sulfur for the <a data-href="Pale Blight" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/terms-and-phrases/pale-blight.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Pale Blight</a>. Thaddeus has made quite the impression on the locals. I look forward to seeing which of us first pops our cherry, so to speak, with the Fae.<br>
We shopped around for some supplies. I got a set of bone dice; might spend some time “fixing” them up. It might be best to keep my scams on the low for now. I’m awfully tricksy, but the Fae are better. Maybe I’ll learn something…<br>
Below are two sketches: one of the bone dice, and one of the tiefling Pride, surrounded by butterlfies and hearts, saying: "Ooh, Teddy, gimme a kiss"<br>
<img alt="23rd_Bloomweave_p1.jpg" src="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/lib/media/23rd_bloomweave_p1.jpg"><br>Speaking of learning something, we’ve set up in the <a data-href="Crimson Inn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/businesses/crimson-inn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Crimson Inn</a> here in Mosskarm. While the genasi, half-elf, and I sat down to a game with a Pixie, <a data-href="Dex" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Dex" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Dex</a>, Runa spoke with the innkeeper about the poachers they’re looking for. Whatever they said, it earned us a fine reward of booze. I sipped it, but some of my companions drank it down like they were dying of thirst. So much for caution.<br>
Whatever disappointment I felt in the other two, I was deeply impressed by Thaddeus. He and I managed to convince Dex to part with some more information about <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thousand-Eyed Deceiver" data-href="Thousand-Eyed Deceiver" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/demons/thousand-eyed-deceiver.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Zirel</a> and anyone associated with them.<br>
We got the drunkards into a room to sleep it off, though both of them seem keen on fighting it off instead. Gods help Corvaux if fighting turns to… you know.<br>
I took some time to case the inn. I know that Runa disapproves of my methods, so it’s better if I do this on my own, at least until I know the others a bit better. I found a group of Sun Elves &amp; Eladrin. They called me “Vari”—they’re Summerlings, refugees. My group of weirdos are now conveniently refugees ourselves. I had to double-down on a lie, but I got a great deal of information. The <a data-href="Spring" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/spring/spring.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Spring</a> court is in turmoil, the land turned into a battlefield. I don’t know exactly what’s going on, but if there’s chaos, he’s likely hiding in it.<br>
Good thing to know: Corvaux is quick to back up a lie. We’re in-laws for the duration of our time here—she’s the beloved sister to my dearly departed husband. I don’t know what made me say it. No, I do. I just can’t think about it now. It won’t change anything.<br> I thought of <a data-href="Paelias" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/paelias.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Paelias</a> while in reverie. Of wiping his snotty nose when he cried after scraping up his knee, of putting him to bed while Mama and <a data-href="Rodan" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Rodan" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Rodan</a> went out. I remembered… I remembered how it ended. It will never leave me.<br>Corvaux saw. Gods damn her back to wherever she came from. She saw. She was kind, sitting beside me and talking about it. She tried to comfort me, to tell me there is nothing to be ashamed of, gnawing on myself like an animal. She doesn’t understand. She cannot understand.<br>
I’m the only one in my wretched bloodline to know shame. It’s the only thing that keeps me from turning out like There is a large splotch of ink here, where a pen was pressed to the point of breaking.<br>I am the harbinger of my own fate. I will not chew my nails.<br>
I will not ache for this. I am the harbinger of my own fate. I will not chew my nails. I will not ache for this. I am the harbinger of my own fate. I will not chew my nails.<br>I will not ache for this. Not again.]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/mirri-12.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Mirri 12.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 23:36:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/lib/media/23rd_bloomweave_p1.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/lib/media/23rd_bloomweave_p1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mirri 14]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Hopefully still Bloomweave, 515 of 3A.<br>
Day 2 in the Feywilds<br> We’ve left <a data-href="Mosskarm" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/winter/mosskarm.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mosskarm</a>. I’m almost disappointed that we are leaving so soon, but the wilds beckon. And they are cold. The necklace <a data-href="Aerendyl" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/aerendyl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aerendyl</a> gave me keeps me plenty warm—I’ve used the Shiftweave to give the impression of winter gear without actually needing it.<br> We traveled for a few hours, I assume, given that time works a bit strangely here. The landscape is entirely blanketed in snow… it’s beautiful, in a way I can’t quite describe, like… the antithesis of the Void. We stopped for a break &amp; I asked Aerendyl about his homeland. I know he was present at the university in <a data-href="Sandfall City" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/earth-plane-(elemental)/sandfall-city.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sandfall City</a>, so regardless of what I find here, I’d like to know more. I need to know more.<br> <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaddeus</a> and I discussed our pacts &amp; our souls. I wish I could help him, I wish I could tell him that this will get better, but I don’t know if it will. I don’t know. What is clear to me is just how… lucky I ended up. His pact and mine are so vastly different. My patron is perhaps the only true friend I have ever known and even that word, friend, is too small a word to encompass the truth of it. And the worst of it is that I cannot even begin to articulate how my pact came about because—<br>Ugh. I encouraged Aerendyl to do something foolish to take their eyes off of me. His attempts to… “woo” <a data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Runa</a> were painful to witness, but they made for a fine distraction. I hope we can leave this place soon. I don’t like sticking to a story longer than a day or two.<br>We paused our hunt for Runa’s poachers to visit an icy shrine. Our guide fed some Redcaps with blood to keep them sated and I followed suit. I don’t have any plans on waking the dead. Thaddeus, on the other hand, gave a very impassioned speech about what he might learn of lost civilizations if he had the option to rouse the dead. He also wants an interview with a Redcap and a Revenant if he can find them.<br> Thaddeus is a gift wrapped in silver ribbons for someone like him.<br>That is what worries me the most.<br>We’ve found a big hole. Runa’s poachers are probably waiting at the bottom for the monster that has made its nest there. We’ve set up camp to wait for these poachers to return. I’m not sure what we’ll do with them—our taciturn half-orc companion hasn’t said much about what their goals are here… but I cannot fault them in that regard.

 <br>? Bloomweave, 515 of 3A.<br>
Day 3 in the Feywilds<br>We woke to one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen. The second moon, <a data-href="Lucanthus" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Lucanthus" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Lucanthus</a>, was shining high in the sky and the snowfall was illuminated by a prismatic aurora from the moon… it was incredible. I could have stared at it for hours. I sometimes forget just how beautiful these places can be… how often have I become too focused on the hunting of him that I’ve missed the rest of the world around us? I wish I was a better artist so I could have captured it forever.<br>I have, however, captured the beautiful sculptures that greeted us, molded by the careful hand of <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a>: behold, the Snow-friends! We need a name for our weird little gang…<br><img alt="25th_Bloomweave_p1.jpg" src="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/lib/media/25th_bloomweave_p1.jpg"><br>We’ve learned that the beautiful effect of the second moon is a Wild Magic Surge. Great. My fellow warlock sprouted a pair of gossamer dragonfly wings! I tested an Eldritch Blast, but didn’t fully cast it, afraid of hitting something or someone out in the darkness.<br>I tried to cast Guidance as well, but it also failed. Great! I’m absolutely thrilled to be as useless as a Drow in a desert, as <a data-href="Calimar" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Calimar" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Calimar</a> used to say.<br>Gods, stop thinking about Cal, you thrice-damned fool. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaddeus</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Obsidian" data-href="Obsidian" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/animal-companions/obsidian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sid</a> have gone down the Hole. I don’t know how long we’ll have to wait.<br>Thaddeus and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Obsidian" data-href="Obsidian" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/animal-companions/obsidian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sid</a> have returned, I assume. We can hear the archaeologist’s voice, but we can’t see him. I’m assuming that his invisibility spell hasn’t worn off, yet another gift from Wild Magic. He says he tasted (???) some coagulated blood and described the layout of the Hole. We’re going in after <a data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Runa</a>’s poachers. Runa still hasn’t given much in terms of answers, but I’m hardly one to judge in that regard.<br>And speaking of Runa! They cast some sort of spell and sprouted ANTLERS. We hadn’t gotten far into a long crevice before the poachers noticed us. It wasn’t a long fight, or particularly difficult—one dwarf got away, but we’ll be following shortly. Runa found 600 silver for each of us, 3,000 in total, and I’ve picked up some silver ink used with evocation spells, a decent pile of Blink Dog teeth and claws, and bark from a Dryad’s heart-tree which is the only salvageable part of this godsforsaken hole because I’VE GOT WINGS??

 <br>Session 16, part 2 of 3<br>
Still Day 3 in the Feywilds<br>Just when I thought the day was going well. We landed in a fight with the poachers that <a data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Runa</a>’s been searching for. They had the benefits of invisibility, or something like it. I managed to hear them coming, at least, though the damage I did was minimal at best. At least I got some money out of it.<br><a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> got hurt. Badly. I’d hoped some playful flirting and a gift of platinum might… I don’t know what it would have helped. I don’t know at all. I need to be useful to these people… or at the very least entertaining. I can do entertaining. I can do fun.<br>While we were recovering, taking shelter in the camp we raided, our dear <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaddeus</a> revealed that he has been courting the idea of deals with devils in the hopes that it might free them from the Pact. I didn’t really get a chance to process the insanity of it before Corvaux tore him a new one and stormed off.<br>I managed to convince my fellow warlock to be patient. I know he’s scared, I know he’s desperate. I’ve been there and I’ve suffered for it. But something they said… something about trading something to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thousand-Eyed Deceiver" data-href="Thousand-Eyed Deceiver" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/demons/thousand-eyed-deceiver.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Zirel</a> in return for their soul. I felt <a data-href="Hallow" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/hallow.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Hallow</a>’s fear and distress at the very thought of the question.<br>I don’t like this. I don’t like it at all. We need to get somewhere safe, back to some sort of civilization. I need to sleep, properly sleep. There are things Hallow and I need to discuss. I know he has a hand in this, somehow, and if he doesn’t… he would at least know where to start looking.<br>That is not a thought I should ever entertain. It’s as insane as Thaddeus wanting <a data-href="Asmodeus" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/devils/asmodeus.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Asmodeus</a> to break his pact. And it’s certainly not a thought I can voice aloud, knowing what I know now. I saw Runa crush the skull of that Drow. I’ve heard Corvaux’s verbal assault. <a data-href="Aerendyl" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/aerendyl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aerendyl</a> seemed to sit peacefully out of the way, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t capable of the same violence as the rest of us.<br>I doubt that they’d enjoy my secrets. I’m loath to admit it, but it’s not just shame keeping my tongue tied. It’s fear.]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/mirri-16.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Mirri 16.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 23:28:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mirri 17]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>End of Day 3 in the Feywilds<br>We left the hole rather suddenly. It was for the absolute best, of course, considering the harrowing details given to the group by <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaddeus</a>. After a tense discussion of what our next steps are, we have decided to head to <a data-href="Autumn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/autumn/autumn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Autumn</a>, to the <a data-href="Fallen Halls" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Fallen Halls" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Fallen Halls</a>. To him.<br>To say I feel sick to my stomach at the thought of it is an understatement. It’s one thing to see his likeness sketched, to see wanted posters that show me that he has grown older, thinner. It is another thing entirely to face him again. I want nothing more than to put him in the ground. I want nothing more than to understand, at long last, why he has done any of this in the first place.<br>We left the hole, its ghosts, &amp; its devils behind, hopefully. Along the path, we encountered two pixies, one in hysterics over what ended up being a simple abandoned pack. The other was quite fascinated with my hair, much to my anguish. I can’t wait for it to be back to normal, to run a proper brush through it again. Damn wild magic.<br>As we decided to set up camp here on the mountainside and continue on to a nearby village in the morning (?) Thaddeus said he wished to talk.<br>
I gathered what I’d need to clean up after I commune with <a data-href="Hallow" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/hallow.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Hallow</a> first. I’m used to the aftermath, but my companions are not, so it’s best to be prepared ahead of time.<br>Surprisingly mild swearing in <a data-href="Abyssal" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/languages/abyssal.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Abyssal</a> is scrawled across the page<br>

you bastard idiot pointed-ear little fucker
<br>How can one so smart as Thaddeus be so fucking stupid?!?<br>I’m on my third cup of tea because that godsdamned bottle we found in the pack is too expensive to waste, but—How can he even CONSIDER calling upon a devil to break his Pact?

He chose his own survival. I will not hold that against him. No, it is the path he chose that I take issue with. Three souls in exchange for his own, three lives forever altered, ended maybe, to save his own skin. I have done some nasty things to keep myself alive and I’ve no qualms with killing… but I could not do that. I could not force another to endure what I have, save the man who put me here.<br>
I will remember the bright-eyed academic who had the habit of reading everything aloud. I will remember the young man I knew so briefly. I will mourn that I could not save him.<br>
But I will remember him. I will remember him, the name of his Patron, and the new pact he forged. I hope he will never have to face someone like me, young and broken and filled with hatred for a man they did not know, who destroyed their life in a single act of selfishness.<br>I only wish that I had not said so much. To have these people who have known me only a matter of days know what no one else ever has?<br>Worst of all was <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> telling me of a green-eyed shadow that watches over me. I know who it was she saw. I wish she had said nothing. I wish she had let me have but one moment where I did not have to remember it. One more moment between sleeping and waking where he was safe and I had not failed. Corvaux did not intend to tear the wound open, but it bleeds again all the same.<br>He would be about Thaddeus’ age, now.<br>All this melancholy has distracted me from a gift that nearly drove me to tears—genuine ones, not the false tears that fall after my dreams. <a data-href="Hallow" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/hallow.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Hallow</a> has gifted me new marks on the palms of my hands. My hands, the focus of my anxiety and shame. My hands, that I have spent so many years avoiding, clenching in fists at my sides so that I would not put them near my mouth. And she has chosen them to hold the symbols of her love, her pride.<br>

Oh, Thaddeus, you frightened fool. I want no one bound by Pact to know anything other than this. Even a fraction of this unwavering loyalty, of the love I have never been able to hold onto in the waking world.<br>It doesn’t matter now.

 <br>Bloomweave, 515 of 3A.<br>
Day 5 in the Feywilds<br>We found ourselves a cave to rest in and introduced ourselves properly to the Tabaxi we picked up yesterday; <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Luck of the Draw" data-href="Luck of the Draw" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Luck-of-the-Draw</a>, also known by an alias of Jerinn. A man (cat?) after my own heart—I wasn’t pleased to lose my bag of Blink Dog teeth and claws, but I am more than happy to help a like-minded entrepreneur make some quick gold!<br>Unfortunately, the giddiness of finding a friend keen on making mischief with me was short-lived. I was right… the <a data-href="Ambassador Ushan" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Ambassador Ushan" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ambassador Ushan</a> Luck spoke of was indeed the same one I know.

I’d say the kindest estimate would be about 300 years, going off of the dogwood story.<br><a data-href="Lord Lysenthir" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Lord Lysenthir" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Lord Lysenthir</a> is the Spring Emissary now, at any rate.

Not that it will make up for the rest of it…<br>I took the last watch with <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a>, thinking hard on how long we have been here ourselves. My journal says five days, but is that even right?

Will I return a hundred years later than when I left, having not aged a day?<br>I did take a moment to inform Corvaux of my intentions with some of <a data-href="Hallow" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/hallow.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Hallow</a>’s newest gifts… and I was reminded again that I’m, well, me.

The godsdamned dwarf came back through the mage’s pack and attacked my friend. The little fucker was dead in under a minute. Good riddance.<br>I know I snapped at Runa and I shouldn’t have. I should have been kinder, I should have made sure they were okay first, asked questions later, but I just… I couldn’t stop myself. I saw the blood and my mind… I know where it went. That’s not the point. I should know better by now.<br>We went through the bag. There were measures in place to prevent intruders, something we should have thought of, but didn’t, and the bars of the cage were the same as the metal from those manacles. The ones that I could not break off. I know that they vanished after… after and I never did figure out where they went. Only the cost of their removal.<br>Aerendyl said they were made of cold iron. I don’t care what it’s called, I want to be as far away from it as possible. The very touch of it brings back memories that I don’t want to endure more than I already do.<br>First Runa, bleeding and hurt. Then the iron. I shouldn’t have snapped at her but all I could think of was…<br>Stop getting attached, Mirri, you thrice-damned, hypocritical fool. You know how it will end. They are your friends as long as you are useful to them. So be useful.<br>Runa freed us by adding us to a ledger for these Bloody Poachers. Their base, if that is what this place is, is open to us and what little I’ve found so far only confirms the half-orc’s words—these are “bad people.”<br>I know she doesn’t like me and probably never will, but Runa at least felt comfortable dumping some magical equipment onto me. I can do that. I can be useful. I can be a mage if that is what they need. Be useful.<br>Find out who’s singing. That’s useful.]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/mirri-19.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Mirri 19.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 23:21:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mirri 20]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>End of Day 5 in the Feywilds<br>Our mysterious songbird was a little goblin child. While <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Luck of the Draw" data-href="Luck of the Draw" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Luck</a> and <a data-href="Aerendyl" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/aerendyl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aerendyl</a> explored the larder to replace our rations, <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> and I slipped into the shadows, exploring the other rooms. I found a forge containing many magical things, including flail snail eggs and a strange metal I could not identify. It looked rusted, but it radiated heat. I decided it was best to be cautious and avoid touching it until the others could look for themselves. I packed the eggs and some of the notes into my bag. The notes were either written in a cypher or in Infernal, neither of which I could understand at that moment.<br>The goblin child, <a data-href="Jinx" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/jinx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jinx</a>, was singing to a prisoner, someone by the name of <a data-href="Tanis" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/tanis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tanis</a>. Someone that <a data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Runa</a> knew.<br>I know nothing of the <a data-href="Orcish" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Orcish" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Orcish</a> tongue, know nothing of what they said to each other, but I do not have to. I understand. I understand so thoroughly it makes me heartsick. We are more alike than I believed us to be, Runa and I. I understand the violence they have inflicted upon these poachers better than anyone. I know what pain they have endured in silence, their reluctance to speak of it save to ask for help in killing the people who took everything from them.<br>Jinx was frightened of us, all of us, and I can tell that she has been treated cruelly by the poachers who operate here. Tanis informed us that <a data-href="Dain's Prison" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Dain's Prison" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Dain's Prison</a> is a demi-plane that belongs to a tiefling wizard called <a data-href="Spite" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Spite" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Spite</a>. I wasted no time insisting that we leave as soon as possible. Another mage like him is the last thing we need.<br>On our way out, I swore I could see a face in the flames of the braziers we passed. I stole the ledger bearing our names—if what I saw was real, if our trespass was noticed, I’d rather not hand the bastard our identities to make it easier to find us.<br>We rested for a while, allowing Tanis some time to recover. She is a former Captain of the Wall, guarding <a data-href="Sylvari" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/sylvari/sylvari.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sylvari</a> from the <a data-href="Yew Forest" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Yew Forest" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Yew Forest</a>. To my surprise, she knew of him and said that he had been thrown out of the <a data-href="Ironwood Citadel" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/sylvari/ironwood-citadel.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ironwood Citadel</a> several times. Though I have hunted him across all of Sylvari, it still shocks me how infamous he truly is… and it infuriates me to know how long he has gotten away with so much.<br>I had been trying to distract myself by making tea and caring for the little one. Jinx insisted she is not a child, she’s 16. Luck was shocked to learn my age, as if 112 is not only a decade out from standard elven adulthood &amp; Corvaux is senior to me, is she not?<br>
Our playful banter soon turned serious and we argued about what to do with the bag. I was in favor of laying a trap, but in the end, Corvaux placed it into their bag of holding.<br>
We packed up camp, once again setting course for Autumn. We met the pixies again and I admit, I could not come up with another tale for the life of me. Carrying Jinx on my back reminded me of happier times, of days filled with sunshine and laughter, of <a data-href="Paelias" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/paelias.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Paelias</a> begging me to do the trick with my ears. I haven’t done it in decades. I wonder if I even still can. In any case, I paid little attention to the pixies and their games. I only hope it doesn’t come back to bite me in the ass, as most things do.<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Scarlet Maple" data-href="Scarlet Maple" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/winter/scarlet-maple.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">The Scarlet City</a> awaits, yet I am torn between excitement and dread. No, not dread. Homesick. Heartsick.<br>It is no one’s fault but his, but still… it hurts.

 <br>? Bloomweave, 515 of 3A.<br>
Day 6 in the Feywilds<br>We’ve arrived in the <a data-href="Scarlet City" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Scarlet City" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Scarlet City</a>, the last city in <a data-href="Winter" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/winter/winter.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Winter</a> before we head into <a data-href="Autumn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/autumn/autumn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Autumn</a>. What awe at the beauty I saw there, from the twisting branches of the massive tree at the heart of the city to the colors of fall, was soon overshadowed by the fact that the <a data-href="Crimson Gaze" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/factions/crimson-gaze.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Crimson Gaze</a> was docked here.<br>The Gaze! That beautiful ruby beauty! I couldn’t believe my eyes, but there she was, just as incredible as she was the last time I saw her. Oh, to think that I had been so young that first time, stuttering out my very first alias to get myself aboard. My first proper drink, my first proper kiss… Ember. That was her name. I remember her like it was yesterday. She had the most incredible eyes.<br>And I remember the friends I went with, the Moon Rats like myself who had heard every story, no matter how outrageous, same as me. There was <a data-href="Ros" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Ros" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ros</a>, <a data-href="Caper" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Caper" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Caper</a>, and <a data-href="Eilonwy" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Eilonwy" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Eilonwy</a>. Funny, to think back on them now. I wonder where they are now, how they are doing. I heard Ros and Eilonwy were married at some point, but we had moved in with <a data-href="Rodan" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Rodan" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Rodan</a> by then and I was too busy caring for <a data-href="Paelias" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/paelias.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Paelias</a> to slip away to attend. Not that I think either of them would want their ex-girlfriend at their wedding, all things considered.<br>
Regardless, I did not hesitate to relay to my companions how desperately I wanted to visit the ship. I could have waxed poetic for hours. Before we went out, we stopped by the inn, <a data-href="Froggit About It" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/businesses/froggit-about-it.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Froggit About It</a>, and there, <a data-href="Tanis" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/tanis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tanis</a>, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Luck of the Draw" data-href="Luck of the Draw" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Luck</a>, and <a data-href="Aerendyl" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/aerendyl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aerendyl</a> decided they would much rather sleep than explore. Their loss! <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> and I made for the shops, grabbing more suitable outfits for such a grand occasion. <a data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Runa</a> declined a change of clothes, but I could hardly care when Corvaux appeared looking like that. Gods save me, I might require a room to myself before the night is over. I haven’t… well, I cannot say I haven’t indulged since my last great heartache, but pathetic one-night-stands have never sated me. If Corvaux asks, though, the answer is a resounding yes.<br>I found myself tongue-tied as soon as we stepped aboard. It was overwhelming, standing on those red decks again, feeling like a giddy teen. Runa, Corvaux, and I all agreed to a fight, providing entertainment and hoping to win a bit of coin, too. I kept an eye on <a data-href="Jinx" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/jinx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jinx</a> while we waited for our turn. I hope… I hope this place inspires in her what it did in me all those decades ago. If there is any place in any plane of existence where she might be safe from both the poachers and him, it would be here.<br>I must speak with the captain before the night is done. Runa’s fight starts soon. This should be a night to remember.]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/mirri-21.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Mirri 21.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 19:02:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mirri 22]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Who fucking knows, Bloomweave, 515 of 3A.<br>
Day 7 in the Feywilds<br>Hungover. I hate everything and everyone, most notably myself.<br>Such a stellar start to my day, honestly. Not only am I fighting the hangover sent from the depths of the Abyss itself, but <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> delightedly informed all of us that they have an ATD… an abyssally transmitted disease, or <a data-href="phage" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/phage" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">phage</a>. I thought it was a joke, at first, some ribbing about something I certainly thought about doing with her, but hadn’t actually done, but no. It was real. So, to the healers we go to ensure we haven’t all been infected with whatever nasty shit came out of the business end of some demon.<br>The healer examined us and gave us a run-down of what to expect. This particular phage comes from the 108th layer of the Abyss. Corvaux asked me how I knew of that layer, but I managed to avoid answering. If he’s meddling with it, tearing haphazardly into it, he’s risking more lives than I thought. I need to find out what he wants there, what is driving him and his followers to seek it out… and if they have some form of protection from it.<br>Speaking of protection… I pulled Captain Havoc aside last night. We spoke of <a data-href="Jinx" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/jinx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jinx</a> and my desire to have her join the crew of the <a data-href="Crimson Gaze" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/factions/crimson-gaze.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Crimson Gaze</a> in the hope that they might be able to protect her from the poachers… and anything else that might want to harm her. She’s a brilliant child, intelligent and eager to please, and as much as it breaks my heart to leave her behind, I know it’s for the best. She will be safer when she is not with me. We meet with the captain at midday.<br>Oh, and by the way, Corvaux is from <a data-href="Yewdon" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/yewdon/yewdon.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Yewdon</a>. The Cursed Forest. And I thought my origins were cause for concern. Well, at least if it outs, I will be in grand company, I suppose.<br>What strikes me the most is how… hopeless Corvaux is about the <a data-href="Blight" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Blight" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Blight</a> and Yewdon. She says there is no hope for her home, and while I cannot find it in myself to argue the finer points with her, knowing only an outsider’s perspective… it just… It hits close. I know that hopelessness in my own way. That loneliness. I’m tempted to call in favors that don’t even exist if it might make a difference. But I know better.<br>After the healers took <a data-href="Tanis" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/tanis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tanis</a> and Jinx, the rest of us headed out to finish our shopping. We first stopped by a menagerie for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Luck of the Draw" data-href="Luck of the Draw" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Luck</a> to purchase his moorbounder. Oh, the beasties! I could have blown every gold in my purse then and there, but I remembered my list of components for finding my Familiar and instead settled for bullying <a data-href="Aerendyl" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/aerendyl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aerendyl</a> into adopting an ice wolf pup.<br>
His name is <a data-href="Grout" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Grout" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Grout</a> and he is the most adorable thing!!! Those little teeth will be man-maulers in no time! Oh, I can’t wait to see how this goes. Aeren refused to allow me to shirk responsibility, so we are co-parenting our pup. I’d be a terrible mother, but a stepmother? I think I can manage that just fine, so that’s how I’ll approach it.<br>We also swung by the <a data-href="Drunken Cantor" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Drunken Cantor" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Drunken Cantor</a>, where we met the shopkeeper, <a data-href="Josiah" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/josiah.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Josiah</a>. I purchased what I needed for my spells, as well as a sparking ring, just for fun. I also grabbed a pair of goggles, a scarf, gloves, as well as a change of clothes if we happen to run into the <a data-href="Pale Blight" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/terms-and-phrases/pale-blight.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Pale Blight</a> that <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> warned us about. I also nabbed a small trinket for Jinx… something to remember me by.<br>I split off from my companions and took Jinx shopping for some proper pirate attire. I didn’t want to get her hopes up too high, but I would do anything to ensure she gets a position on that ship. I cannot take her into a fight against him. I can’t… I can’t endure that again. We met with the captain, <a data-href="Wisp" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/wisp.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Wisp</a>, <a data-href="Grace" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/grace.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Grace</a>, and <a data-href="Confidence" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/confidence.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Confidence</a>. They asked their questions and got answers they seemed to like… up until the moment <a data-href="Jinx" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/crimson-gaze/jinx.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jinx</a> left to explore the ship with Grace and the captain called me out for my marks.<br>I expected that, and half-lied my way through it. What I did not expect was to be asked if I wished to join them as well.<br>
In another life, in my youth, I would have jumped at the opportunity. I would have given everything up then and there if it meant that kind of freedom. I have long admired and dreamed of that ruby ship, of her crew, of a life untethered. There was a time I would have said yes.<br>But they asked me if I wished to be free of my Pact. I did not lie in saying that it was him who did this to me, but… I could never abandon <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Hallow" data-href="Hallow" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/hallow.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Hallow</a>. I could never willingly leave her behind. Yes, I have my gripes with how the Pact came to be, with the fact that we were both robbed of our choice, but… I will stay with Hallow until my last breath is squeezed from my corpse and not a moment before.<br>It is just one more dream to be forgotten. No, passed on. Jinx will thrive here, I can tell. And who knows? Maybe I will see her again when the ship next makes port in <a data-href="Solantha" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Solantha" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Solantha</a>. What a sweet reunion that might be…<br>Until then, I’m off to train with Confidence. I’ve long been able to use both hands for many things, including writing, so I’m eager to properly learn to wield dual swords and forget the sour taste in the back of my mouth that tells me I am losing, once again, a chance at a good life.]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/mirri-22.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Mirri 22.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 18:54:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mirri 23]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Though I have not known her long, I can’t help the swell of pride that fills me. She’s going to be the carpenter’s mate and she seems eager to start her newest journey. Most importantly, she will be safe aboard the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Crimson Gaze" data-href="Crimson Gaze" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/factions/crimson-gaze.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Gaze</a>, safer than anywhere else.<br>Some days, you really do win.

Some days, you win. And everything, for a little while, at least, is okay.<br>Speaking of wins, I traded my flail snail egg shards and powder to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Luck of the Draw" data-href="Luck of the Draw" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Luck</a> for a future favor. I’m not sure what favor I’ll call in, nothing grandiose, of course, but I’ll think on it for a while. A favor is a powerful thing to have in our line of work, so I’ll make it count.<br>Other than that, the rest of the day, for some of us, at least, was not particularly eventful. We returned to <a data-href="Froggit About It" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/businesses/froggit-about-it.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Froggit About It</a> to rest for the evening. While their drinks seemed enticing, my head is still pounding, so I figured it was best if we actually recover before another night of partying. We chose the Giant’s Cabin room and gods, what a choice! We explored the massive accommodations, scrambling up the sides of chairs to reach the top of the table, standing beside a bed bigger than any of us could have imagined! <a data-href="Aerendyl" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/aerendyl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aerendyl</a> went for the massive bath, intent on a swim, and I found myself climbing up the bookshelves to a swing on the bough of a bonsai tree. I felt like a girl again.

I wasn’t paying much attention to where they were going. I’m after one of those cinnamon rolls when I land this next jump from the swing to the bed.<br>Luck and Corvaux returned with <a data-href="Ralph" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/animal-companions/ralph.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ralph</a> the Moorbounder in tow after not just flirting with Death, but kissing Death with tongue.

I did not know Runa long, but I did know her longer than I have known the others. Unlike <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thaddeus Quill" data-href="Thaddeus Quill" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/thaddeus-quill.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaddeus</a>’ departure, there was no argument, no disagreement… she just… left. And yet, I cannot really feel grief nor sorrow at their leaving. They were reunited with <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Tanis" data-href="Tanis" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/tanis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Tanix</a> and their <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Runa > Departure" data-href="Runa#Departure" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html#Departure" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">letter</a> says they are returning to the <a data-href="Ironwood Citadel" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/sylvari/ironwood-citadel.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ironwood Citadel</a>. Maybe it is as simple as “duty calls.”<br>
Regardless, I let <a data-href="Aerendyl" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/aerendyl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aerendyl</a> know immediately and the others when they woke. We ate the breakfast the room provided for us and packed our things to leave.<br>Into <a data-href="Autumn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/autumn/autumn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Autumn</a> we go, to the <a data-href="Fallen Halls" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Fallen Halls" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Fallen Halls</a>. The locals recoiled when we asked for directions towards the place, refusing to speak of it by name. I understand that sort of superstition… I have only written his name once within these pages. The locals also spoke of a wailing witch in the northern part of the forest and shadows in the trees.<br>
The hike was relatively pleasant. The weather grew warmer as we left Winter behind. Though <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw" data-href="Entities/Player Characters/Luck of the Draw" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Luck</a> seemed to stumble a bit on the trail, we eventually found our way to a temple of the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="The Raven Queen" data-href="The Raven Queen" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/the-raven-queen.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Raven Queen</a>. There was a lute being played nearby, an eerie, haunting song.<br>
We’ve found the source of the music! Her name is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Deidre" data-href="Deidre" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/deidre.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Deirdre</a>. She has elven features, but they’re more delicate, almost faerie-like. I’m assuming she’s a native of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Feywild" data-href="Feywild" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">the Feywilds</a>, perhaps. And she immediately began buttering us up, asking if we could help free her from her captors. Apparently she is tethered or trapped by a cult of some kind, wearing animal masks. It would be infinitely satisfying to put them down.<br>
We stopped into the temple briefly for Luck. Deidre and I flirted a little because I simply cannot help myself. When was the last time a relationship with a bard fond of the color black went well for me? Never. It has never gone well for me. Don’t even think about it, Mirri.<br>
Aeren helped me find a solid stick of rowan wood to use. I explained its purpose and what it might do to help in our future endeavors.<br>We left the temple and continued on our way to free Deirdre. However, along the way, <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> told us suddenly to stop. I’m crouched down behind a tree with Luck, wondering what’s happening<br>

 <br>Bloomweave, 515 of 3A.<br>
End of Day 8 in the Feywilds<br>Well, now that we’re done jumping at shadows, literally and figuratively, I’ve come to a conclusion. The stories I was told growing up about <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Feywild" data-href="Feywild" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">the Feywilds</a> are complete bullshit. Sure, there might be some hope for the <a data-href="Summer" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/summer/summer.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Summer</a> Court, but all that I’ve learned since I’ve been here has done nothing but disappoint me.<br>Poor <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> took a beating, so I’ve offered my arm for the time being. As we neared the “manor” that <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Deidre" data-href="Deidre" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/deidre.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Deidre</a> told us about, I was surprised to see not a house, but a massive tree. It wasn’t until we got much closer that I saw the stained glass windows and carved steps. Once inside, we started to explore, poking around every crevice and destroyed room. Gods, how long has this place been in pieces? Or, more concerning, how long has Deidre been here?<br>
As we climbed the tower, feeling the beginnings of exhaustion in my bones, we came at last to the living space and there, upon the head of a gaudy statue, was a jester’s hat fit for a king of fools. I had to have it, so once it was secured, I continued my exploration. Deidre’s Alarm Spell was set at the door, though half of it was just the word “beans” written over and over again in various tongues. None of the traps we have seen were dangerous—they were warnings only. Strange.<br>
Corvaux and I spoke with Deidre about <a data-href="Eristalon" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/eristalon.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Eristalon</a>, though we did not get far. Her captors were connected to Eristalon, somehow, though getting information from anyone here about it is like pulling teeth. Deidre was a pet bard, bound to this place and forced to entertain.<br>
I wanted to rest for a while, but Corvaux called me upstairs and I am so glad that they did! There was an art gallery there, filled with cobwebs and strange items. And there was a blue dragon egg, just there for the taking. While <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Luck of the Draw" data-href="Luck of the Draw" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/luck-of-the-draw.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Luck</a> was busy breaking strange stones growing from plants, I swiped the egg, realizing it was hollow. The three books nearby described the dragons shown in the decorations all around, a blue dragon, a gold dragon, and a jade dragon. These hunters, Deidre’s captors, were part of an organization called the <a data-href="Furthest Branch" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Furthest Branch" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Furthest Branch</a>. I’m neither druid nor paladin, but my heart still sank to read about these beautiful creatures, slain for sport and glory.<br>
Speaking of creatures… after we free Deidre tomorrow, it might be the best chance I have to summon a friend for the fight ahead. Here’s hoping it goes well.]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/mirri-25.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Mirri 25.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 21 Apr 2024 22:33:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mirri 26]]></title><description><![CDATA[

[ At the top of the page is a carefully drawn diagram of a summoning circle. The text surrounding it is in <a data-href="Abyssal" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/languages/abyssal.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Abyssal</a>, indicating measurements and notes. ]<br>For fuck’s sake, <a data-href="Aerendyl" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/aerendyl.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aerendyl</a>, SHUT UP!<br><a data-href="Mystra" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/pantheon/mystra.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mystra</a>’s tits, can you let me focus for ten godsdamned minutes? If you’re so concerned about preserving the feelings of someone we met yesterday, then go kiss her ass and leave me alone while I am working.  Especially you, rocks-for-brains. I see you peeking at my journal as if any of this would make sense to you at all.<br>
Finally. Now that my work is finished and I’m not being constantly interrupted in the midst of extremely careful mathematical calculations and careful wording to make Abyssal as inviting as possible, given the nature of the language, I can pay attention to whatever it was that <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> and Aeren thought was so bloody important.<br>Right. Eating my words. Aeren shared this <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Malachi" data-href="Malachi" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/malachi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Stonecutter</a>'s journal as <a data-href="Deirdre" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Deirdre" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Deirdre</a> sketched out the sigils, or an approximation of them, that keep her bound to this place. Whoever this Stonecutter is, their work is fearsome to behold—interrogating demons, devils, and hags? There is even mention of <a data-href="Orcus" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/demons/orcus.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Orcus</a>. Some of this is pre-<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Spellplague" data-href="Spellplague" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/lore/spellplague.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">spell plague</a>. This Stonecutter is ancient, even by my standards. Aeren confirmed it—this journal is nearly 500 years old. The contents of this journal are…<br>Gods, I am shaking with fear. He can never be allowed to get his hands on this. I like Aerendyl, however irritating he is at times, but if it comes to it… Over and over, this journal details one thing: souls are the purest and most concentrated power in the universe… and he has tried to take mine. He failed once.<br>If he knows the truth—he will not fail again.<br>
I am trying to swallow past my own heart lodged in my throat and focus on the task at hand. To undo such an enchantment or curse requires one of two things: delicate handiwork or brute strength. Thankfully, I have the former in spades.<br>
We’ve headed downstairs. Corvaux is working on the door that leads below, where whatever it is that holds Deidre here is located and—<br>
What the fuck do you mean Deidre has no pulse?<br>Gods. There is no pulse at all. She is as cold as death. What the fuck is going on here?<br>I will not let Deirdre out of my sight until I know what is really going on here. My companions are so quick to trust, even Luck, who I thought would know better. We have no idea who she is, nor what waits for us below. This place belonged to Eristalon himself, if the gaudy statues are any indication. And yet, these fools I travel with are turning a blind eye. I know I am guilty of falling for whatever honeyed words drop from a pretty face, but this is too much, even for a tried-and-true fool like myself. No pulse, blamed on the “curse.” Telling us absolutely nothing about what we are facing. Someone is going to get hurt.<br>
.    Or worse. They will be absolutely powerless against the honey-sweet manipulations of someone like him. And I will be delivering fresh victims to his doorstep. I was hard on Thaddeus for this very reason, and now I see it in the rest of them. I can’t watch this happen again.<br>The only good thing that has come from this is that we are all now 2,000 gold richer… and Aeren was bloodied by a living suit of armor. Was it petty to chastise him like a child, as he did to me, though I am more than twice his age? Yes. Do I feel bad about it? Not in the slightest. But we will talk about that another time, when I am not watching Deidre like a hawk.<br>We have left the treasure room behind and come to a tomb. The smell is unbearable, though only Corvaux lost her breakfast. Two of the coffins were open, but one is empty. Much as I want to investigate closer, Deirdre has stepped into the next room and I intend to follow. Whatever she’s looking for, I need to get my hands on anyway if she has any hope of having this undone.]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/mirri-26.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Mirri 26.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 17:12:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/lib/media/screenshot-2.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/lib/media/screenshot-2.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Runa 15]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Personal Diary, Entry 32, 12th of Dewfall, Year 515<br>As described in my previous entry, I am traveling to known sources of ancient information. In the time between entries I have put efforts toward restudying all of my work, the works of other archeologists if it is for artifacts of a similar time, and as of today visiting The <a data-href="Halls of Ancestry" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Halls of Ancestry" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Halls of Ancestry</a>. As I understand it, it is a small and very old archive of information related to the dragons and those of draconic ancestry. Unfortunately, like many things in my life these last few months, things took a turn for the worse. I had expected to gain access to the library, do a cursory search for helpful information, and try to figure out how much of my time the information was worth. <br>Rather, it started normal. The entrance was well hidden, even to someone who knew what to look for. It blends in almost looking like nothing other than a simple cave entrance. Roughly at the same time, an Emerald Dragonborn came upon the entrance with me. They introduced themselves as <a data-href="Lady Liatris" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/lady-liatris.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Lady Liatris</a>, they appeared to have a particular interest in my familiar, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Obsidian" data-href="Obsidian" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/animal-companions/obsidian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sid</a>. We shared some brief conversations about smugglers and archeology before entering the library. Sid sensed something as we entered, I sniffed the air and noticed the smell of burning papers. Together, Lady Liatris and I rushed inside immediately assuming a fire was burning in the library. Having caution for my safety, I used Sid to scout ahead. Lady Liatris used some manner of magic to take on a starry form, had the situation not been so dire I may have paid enough attention to describe it.<br>
Sid pressed onward for me, I observed through their eyes a masked individual attempting to pry something from the wall. I chose to cast an invisibility spell upon  Lady Liatris who followed but did not seem to immediately notice the man, I then spoke through Sid to warn them and had Sid hide on the ceiling. Unfortunately, the invisibility ended up being of little help to us, the masked thief seemingly gave up on their task and ran through the library away from us. Lady Liatris gave chase, I took refuge within my ring so that Sid could get me there much faster than my own feet could. The thief ran into the burning library, got around a corner, and seemed to vanish. Thinking they had got away, I left my ring and sent Sid to inspect where we had first spotted the masked thief.<br>This seemed to have been a very lucky decision on my part, Sid sent simple messages to me that conveyed a strange metallic creature had taken up the work the thief abandoned, prying what I later learned was a topaz from the wall. Lady Liatris in the meanwhile managed to find the thief, hiding just out of sight. They seemed keen on the immediate execution of our thief but rather I chose to enchant the thief into being willing to answer our questions once the flames burning these very valuable books had been put out. While I did my best to save the books, Lady Liatris assisted Sid in recovering that topaz and killing the creature which left behind a small vial of green liquid upon its destruction.<br>
When the fires were put out, and Lady Liatris was present for questioning this thief, we were able to gleam some important information. This person, or others that may be down here with him, were indeed the ones to set this fire. I tried to gleam specific information but it wasn’t very clear to me why they were doing these things, who was involved, what those mechanical creatures are, and several other things. In response to my asking about the strange creatures, if those were theirs, they replied “We have many gifts.” when questioning why they would do this the common response was, and I am paraphrasing, “In with the new, out with the old.” or “Make room for the new.”<br>I had hoped to keep the mask, despite their vague and prideful answer to the question "Is the mask all your group will need to identify you by?" I presumed the mask might help deal with the thief's allies. However in Lady Liatris’ “excitement” while disposing of the thief, the mask and portions of the robe were dissolved. I would like to note for posterity, that my opinions on violent resolution are unchanged I simply didn’t suppose I could stop Lady Liatris, who seemed very keen on killing the thief. I suppose I cannot blame them given the importance a place like this library and temple must hold to themselves especially. In the meanwhile, I attempted to find any of the information I had come to this library for, no such luck but I only had a short time to search so it was unlikely I’d find much amongst the half-burned shelves of books.<br>
Together Lady Liatris and I decided to search the library for this supposed group the thief was with, we entered the temple portion of this library where more of those mechanical creatures were spinning green webs across portions of the temple. The temple seemed to be a worshipping place to a draconic being called “Nexus” a subject that Lady Liatris knew more than I, though I took notice of the old statue and prayers that were etched into the ground around it. Lady Liatris seemed to notice something I hadn’t with the strange webs and began attacking the creatures making them, we defended ourselves as they attacked in turn, destroyed one of them. We then had to chase the second as it ran across the temple, and stopped at a portion of the wall that was worn down and visibly different than the surrounding stone, the creature seemed to be looking for something there but failed to find it and chose to crawl out of view.<br>I write this entry still within the temple, my attempts at finding what that spot of the wall was hiding fruitless for the time being. I am a bit torn on whether I should continue journeying in this place with Lady Liatris. They are very adamant about finding those responsible for this attack on the library with or without me but the present danger has become very clear and leaving now would simply be an act of self-preservation. However, the mystery surrounding today's events would be truly agonizing to leave unsolved despite how little it has to do with my problems. I will have to think about this longer as we explore.]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/thaddeus-0.5.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Thaddeus 0.5.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 00:11:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Thaddeus 0.56]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Personal Diary, Entry 33, 12th of Dewfall, Year 515<br>I would love to rush to the end of todays events, I knew this would be one of those days that had multiple entries but truly I could never had predicted what was in store for me this day.

I rested in the half burned library while Lady Liatris chose to remain within the temple. I had to resummon Sid and hopefully regain the energy needed to confront what may still threaten this archive of knowledge and culture.<br>My rest went uninterrupted however, unlike Lady Liatris who informed me of voices and noises they heard in that hour. Thankfully they stayed out of sight, I shudder to imagine the guilt I would feel had something happened to them when I insisted on resting in different areas. With both of us rested however and ready to investigate we climbed the stairs that were just past where that strange creature pried a topaz from the wall.<br>A crossbow bolt almost immediately found itself sticking out from Lady Liatris's abdomen as the two of us were discussing whether or not to move stealthily. I had moved in to help Lady Liatris, whiffing a blast of eldtrich energy from the ring, my spell focus, on my right hand. Lucky for us both it seemed Lady Liatris did not need my assistance, quickly dispatching of the thief in a similar manner to the last one she killed. Which once again I'd like to repeat, if this weren't clearly a matter of life or death at this point I would be strictly against the use of violence. But people ready to shoot you in the stomach when you turn a corner don't tend to make good conversation.<br>However since it appeared Lady Liatris had the situation well in hand, I got curious about a couple features of this room. The first thing that caught my eye being a large blue crystal, even without magical aid I was able to see this bright blue crystal was emanating abjuration and conjuration. Nearby was a statue, draconic writing describing it as <a data-href="Pyra" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/dragon-spirits/pyra.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Pyra</a> the Savage mage. It depicted a draconic humanoid staring directly at the crystal and with one hand outstretched. The writing around the statue made it clear that Pyra, or perhaps the crystal, required an offering of some kind. <br>My second instinct was that the thieves were going to take this crystal, or worse activating this crystal somehow worked in the thieves favor and they were prying gems from the walls to give to the statue. Unfortunately my first instinct was figuring out how to make this crystal work. The only thing of worth on my person was that topaz, and it belonged to the Halls of Ancestry in the first place so I figured perhaps this would be a fine way to return it.<br>It certainly worked, but I have to be honest what to do next had me completely stumped. The topaz vanished as soon as I offered it to the statues open palm, and behind me forming inside of the crystal was a little illusionary faerie dragon. It was curious on its surroundings, me, and Sid who was curled up inside of my hood. I tried a few things, detect magic, asking the dragon directly, though I avoided commands such as directly telling them to take care of the thieves. My assumption was that I had activated some manner of defensive magic that was here to aid in protecting the Halls of Ancestry but I had no idea how to move forward.<br>The detect magic did reveal the little dragon could breathe out healing magic, and that the statue of Pyra shined with every type of magic imaginable. But before I could come up with anything else to try Lady Liatris spoke to the dragon in <a data-href="Draconic" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/languages/draconic.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Draconic</a>. I don't know what they discussed but when it was over the little dragon dove into the crystal and seemed to disappear. Lady Liatris informed me they were going to wake up "The Old One." and when the walls began to move and shake I had a theory on what exactly that meant, and decided I shouldn't wait to double check. <br>Lady Liatris pointed out there were books in this room that could be some interest to me, I scooped up everything I could then booked it for the exit. Walls, doors, tunnels were all collapsing and something all around me shifted its weight. I barely noticed that Lady Liatris wasn't behind be as I escaped from the cavern entrance. The sight that I beheld after that is beyond words.<br>The ground heaved and split apart before me, then from the depths of the earth, a colossal form began to emerge, pushing aside tons of rock and soil as if they were mere grains of sand. It was a dragon, larger than I could ever imagine with cobalt scales to match the stone it was casting aside as it crawled from the earth and spread its colossal wings. It did not regard me in the slightest, after all to a creature of that size I was but an ant hidden behind blades of grass. Two shapes were clutched in it's claws, a massive almost L-shaped mass of rock with some wood paneling sticking out that I recognized as the library I was resting in. The other shape was not familiar, I can only assume a portion of the Halls of Ancestry I had not seen.<br>That was not the end of the day, I sent Sid into what remained of the Halls of Ancestry to find Lady Liatris and explore further. I found a room of pillars with two dragon skulls facing a flame. But the sight of that dragon "The Old one." shadows over anything else I could have discovered here.<br><img alt="The_Old_One.png" src="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/lib/media/the_old_one.png">]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/thaddeus-0.56.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Thaddeus 0.56.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 00:15:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/lib/media/the_old_one.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/lib/media/the_old_one.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Thaddeus 1]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Personal Diary, Entry 45, 20th of Bloomwave, Year 515<br>Many entries lately, as described in my last entry I am in the ruins I had discovered at the bottom of a well in the <a data-href="Baheera" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/baheera/baheera.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Baheera</a> desert, not far from the <a data-href="Arkehost Oasis" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/baheera/arkehost-oasis/arkehost-oasis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Arkehost Oasis</a>. I am seemingly being tested by the architects of this place, Yuan-ti architects specifically. Interestingly enough it would appear the same hands that built these ruins had worked on the <a data-href="Halls of Ancestry" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Halls of Ancestry" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Halls of Ancestry</a>, or perhaps someone trained under the same architect. My initial theory of this being somehow tied to the Halls of Ancestry is looking more and more accurate, though the follow-up theory of it being a portion of the very same ruins was quickly proven false. Only two rooms were carried away by that dragon, and these ruins have many more chambers than that.<br>For what reason the Yuan-ti built these testing chambers, I do not yet know. Thus far, a majority of the tests have required that I give something to some extent. In the first chamber, the one as described in my last entry, I had to write my name upon the parchment and demonstrate a few spells before the next chamber was available to me. The second chamber was a simple room with many old papers strewn about largely atop an old table in the chamber's center. Everything I could find in the room was some manner of anecdote, personal note, recipe, etc. the chamber wanted me to share personal knowledge it seemed. I offered a significant amount of unpublished findings from my research into an ancient civilization that died out over 1000 years ago. In response I was shown visually much of that same information, appearing upon the chambers ceiling, as well as gaining access to the third chamber.<br>Before I could enter the third chamber however, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Obsidian" data-href="Obsidian" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/animal-companions/obsidian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sid</a> took notice of something. To my surprise, once I had sent Sid to check out whatever it heard and viewed through their senses, a small group of travelers were at the well. One of which was in a bit of a precarious situation, where it seemed they began to try scaling the 200 ft deep well without any rope or climbing kit. We exchanged some brief conversation, they seemed to take some interest in joining me in the ruins, if only due to a partial belief I may need some help. There was a dragonborn with them who claimed to know me, they did however make a remark about stealing Sid and leaving me in the well, so I do hope I didn’t acquaint myself with someone who would actually do such a thing. I briefly watched them as they began the first chamber’s puzzle, and returned to my senses to enter the third room.<br>The third chamber took me much less time than the previous two, I may have also incidentally done something other than the intended “answer” to this chamber but I have yet to make enough observations to be sure. There were four altars, three of which had statues that were depictions of various Gods, each facing a fountain at the chambers center. These Gods were of varying domain, modern relevance, and appearance so in the moment I could not see any pattern. I interacted with the fountain after noting the statues, in the water were various coins. Seeing no other immediate options and knowing that the previous two chambers required I give something, I tossed a gold piece into the water. The empty altar glowed in a strange light, and when I stood atop it I was whisked away. <br>I found myself coming down a short flight of stairs, at the bottom of which another flight leading down and a wide stone slab with a detailed statue of a violet dragon, poised in a curious manner with its head craning to see down a long hallway to the right. Light emanates from the statue, and I can just barely see the outline of a larger room. I had wanted to explore the flight of stairs but found it only led me back to the first, going up or down either flight of stairs always brought me to the other flight of stairs and in front of this statue. I have decided to try and remain here until those travelers can make it here, unfortunately I recalled my familiar Sid and lost any contact with that group. Hopefully this isn’t one of my final entries.<br>
<br>Note to self: Check previous entries for mention of a dragonborn, especially around my visit to the Halls of Ancestry.
<br>Note to self: Ask for and memorize the dragonborns name, unless I find it in one of my entries.
<br>Note to self: I already can’t remember if they all introduced themselves, when we meet, ask for and memorize ALL their names.
<br>Note to self: Take better notes of day to day stuff, not just research and theories.

 <br>Personal Diary, Entry 46, 23rd? of Bloomwave, Year 515<br>It has been a few days since my last entry. Only days ago, I still knew next to nothing of the exact terms of my pact with my patron <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Thousand-Eyed Deceiver" data-href="Thousand-Eyed Deceiver" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/demons/thousand-eyed-deceiver.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Zirel</a>. Not that I know that much now. Since my last entry, keeping events brief, I have learned that Zirel is but one aspect of The Thousand Eyed Deceiver and they have taken on many different names as devil, demon, even celestial amongst many others. I learned that the sigil that I found was a method of summoning demons from the <a data-href="Abyss" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/abyss/abyss.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Abyss</a>, I fought demons. I never thought that would be a truthful statement, I don't think I wanted it to be.<br>
My pact has put me in the rather unfortunate situation where I will either become a vessel for Zirel, for what I assume is just a fraction of The Thousand Eyed Deceiver, so that they may escape their prison. Or, to fail as Zirel's vessel and have the bonds that hold my body together dissolve.<br>In these few days we have also picked up new friends, <a data-href="Runa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/retired/runa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Runa</a> and <a data-href="Mirri" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mirri</a>. Mirri is a warlock as well, but the way they speak of their patron leaves me rather envious. Though if I had my way I'd be rid of the entire thing, and back to writing about the Mythrender society.<br>
For a number of reasons, we have decided the next leg of our journey takes us to <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Feywild" data-href="Feywild" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/feywild.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">the Feywilds</a>. For myself, Mirri spoke of a <a data-href="Vestan Tlanbourn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/vestan-tlanbourn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Vestan Tlanbourn</a>, someone who was communing with Zirel in a place called the <a data-href="Fallen Halls of Eristalon" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Fallen Halls of Eristalon" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Fallen Halls of Eristalon</a>.<br>We entered the <a data-href="Winter" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/winter/winter.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Winter</a> court what may have been two days ago, I believe time here does not work the same as on <a data-href="Rakauvi" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Rakauvi" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Rakauvi</a>, we may find we've been gone no time at all or several years longer once we return. Currently, we rest at a Remorhaz nest that was populated by poachers Runa had to deal with. We found a massive sigil of the king of hell, <a data-href="Asmodeus" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/devils/asmodeus.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Asmodeus</a>, as well as a candle and blood altar within the nest. We also found pixies, warped in a way that they almost seemed more like imps.<br>I verbalized a desire to speak with a devil while telling everyone what I knew about Asmodeus. In the moment it just felt like another method of information gathering, some way for me to learn how to break my pact. Devils are pretty well known for deal making after all. <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> however gave me a much needed reality check, I should not have spoken so flippantly about making deals with any devil, let alone Asmodeus. Though while I do understand it is wrong and shortsighted, I cannot stop thinking about what I read. One of Zirels potential vessels, seemingly having gone mad with their body terribly warped. Then they simply turned to dust.<br>I thought I had made peace with my mortality but it really is different when its staring you in the face. It may be wrong but, if making a deal with a devil meant getting to live, I can't say with absolute certainty anymore I would not take that deal. I often wonder lately if I have changed in any other ways. I still have not killed, a line I'm sure to cross eventually despite my own feelings about violence. In any case, it'd be nothing but foolish for me to try and reach out to a devil, once our rest is over and we are satisfied with what we find in the nest I would much rather just be done with the place.]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/thaddeus-5.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Thaddeus 5.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 18:33:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Thaddeus 6]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Personal Diary, Entry 47, 23rd/24th? of Bloomwave, Year 515<br>This entry has been written, erased, and written again so many times that sections of it are difficult to make out. The handwriting is much more shaky than how Thaddeus typically writes.<br>Read ahead at your own risk, the spoiler tagged sections include secrets that have not and currently cannot be shared in character. In character, if you were somehow able to get your hands on Thaddeus' diary, these sections seem to be entirely gibberish.<br>Our rest ended with some shock, I spotted one of those warped pixies staring at me and soon after received images from <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Obsidian" data-href="Obsidian" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/animal-companions/obsidian.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sid</a> of a creature rising from the lava to grab them. I quickly dismissed Sid so he would remain safe, and was going to run straight for him until something began to happen with <a data-href="Corvaux" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/corvaux.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Corvaux</a> as well.<br>||However, the moment between rising panic and action was much much longer for me. As we all ran, I found myself somewhere entirely different in just one step. A library of sorts, wide assortment of books, paintings depicting various stills of scenery. Including, the perspective I had just before I found myself here. A painting of my friends running to check on Corvaux, painted as if it was looking through my eyes running behind <a data-href="Mirri" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mirri</a>. A devil named <a data-href="Epiphany" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/epiphany.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Epiphany</a> sat in the library, and snapped a book closed as I appeared here.||<br>||In short, they served a ruler of one of the layers of hell, while I was here they asked me of my current struggles. I, regrettably, couldn't stop myself and told them everything that has been weighing on my mind with this pact. That I more than wanted a way out, I needed it. Strangely, when I spoke Ted's name it came out in <a data-href="Abyssal" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/languages/abyssal.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Abyssal</a>. Epiphany recoiled like I had struck her when I spoke that name, said they haven't heard it in a long time. They disappeared for a few minutes afterwards, I summoned Sid and inspected the paintings. I found nothing interesting. When Epiphany returned, negotiations began.||<br>||I want to return to my normal life. I could never do that if anything or anybody could still lay claim to my soul or any other part of me. So I made it immediately clear during the negotiations that my soul was not on the table. I had many stipulations, all to ensure I would have a clean severance from this contract and my pact by the end of it all. Most importantly to me, I was not going to betray my moral code any farther than I already was just speaking to this devil. Epiphany's patron wanted "beautiful souls", I quickly contested the notion until it was explained that this didn't necessarily mean nice or good souls. There are very much souls already bound for the hells that this devil would call beautiful.||<br>||I was asked to collect 3 of these souls. I felt torn, which concerned me the most. I know in my heart that the morally correct thing to have done here was deny speaking or negotiating with the devil in the slightest. But I was too scared. I don't want to betray myself, or Corvaux who had just gotten me to realize how foolish I'm acting, nor betray anyone else. But what is my future if I didn't? I could go home, leave behind my party and wait for whatever fate would befall me. I could look for another way out of my pact, but be forced to almost constantly use this pact magic just to survive with no real idea on how quickly this will lead to my success or failure as Zirels vessel. How quickly it will lead to my death.||<br>||I don't know what I'm dealing with, I don't know how much time I have left, I don't know if there even is another way out of this pact. I'm desperate, I'm scared, and I'm overwhelmed. I asked constant clarifying questions, anything I could think of that I wanted to know or would maybe somehow make this an easier choice for me. I was strong enough to ask for 24 hours to think on it. Then I found myself focusing on the painting, and was running again like I had never left. Though I had a new ring, for when I was ready to decide.||<br>As it turned out, Corvaux was seeing bodies move. It's unclear why only they could see this, but they spoke in infernal calling out to their "lady". ||Thats what Epiphany called their patron, her lady, ruler of <a data-href="Malbolge" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/hell/malbolge.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Malbolge</a>.|| I suggested we simply leave as soon as possible, we eventually all agreed to follow this image of "golden oak" to <a data-href="Autumn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/autumn/autumn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Autumn</a> and search for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Vestan Tlanbourn" data-href="Vestan Tlanbourn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/vestan-tlanbourn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Vestan</a>. After a number of hours of travel, we came across an old campsite and a pair of fey inhabitants fearing over a pair of bags on the road. My mind was elsewhere however, and perhaps not as eloquently as I could've, I broached to the party my concerns about my pact as we set up camp. I've lately realized the lengths I am willing to go to be free of my pact, and I wanted to know what my party would say.<br>Of course, I couldn't get as specific as I liked. But Corvuax, even if they apologized later, made it very clear what their gut reaction would be. But all of their potential solutions are much too slow and unreliable, I love and appreciate that they were willing to help but I simply do not have the strength to push on much longer without guarantees. Corvaux's way out seems much more appealing every passing second, but I cannot do that to the people who love me, I cannot do that to my future. I twisted the new ring on my finger, and began to bleed.]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/thaddeus-6.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Thaddeus 6.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 18:33:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Thaddeus 7]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Personal Diary, Entry 48, The date doesn't particularly matter. <br>After twisting the ring gifted to me by <a data-href="Epiphany" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/epiphany.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Epiphany</a> I had little to say to them before choosing to sign the contract. Only that I wanted, in writing, conformation that I and only I will be responsible for the collection of three beautiful souls as described in my contract. Upon my death or otherwise have an inability to complete the contract, it will simply remain incomplete. The devils aren't to involve any of my associates, friends, or family to complete the contract in my stead.<br>Then I signed it. I only wish I could've told my now ex-party not to bother searching for solutions on my behalf, but until now I couldn't speak of my contract and as such had no reason to give them not to even try. I wonder if the attempt was truly for my benefit, or just to foil the plans of a fiend. I don't pretend to believe I am making a morally right decision here, but I have few and fewer options that I am brave enough to follow through on. At least now I'll know how many people must die in my presence before my journey is over. Hells, that number can even be zero with this contract.<br>If things get more complicated, if there ends up being even further steps to my freedom after this contract, I'm going home. I'm going to hug my father, finish my thesis, publish my findings, then I'm buying a vial of strong poison and finding somewhere nice to look out towards. My body, my mind, and my soul will never be the playthings of higher powers.<br>As stated, I have been separated from my party. Partially, perhaps mostly by choice. But also as I had predicted my choice to deal with devils was largely unacceptable to the party. Many words were shared, many threats as well. Most hurtful were <a data-href="Mirri" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/player-characters/mirri.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mirri</a>'s, to compare me to a vile man whom I have only had glimpses into their evil nature. I am not willing to do anything and everything to free myself of this pact or to complete any of my other goals. My character, my morality has been chipped away on my year long journey, people have already died in my presence with shocking glee or ferocity from my compatriots. Worse still when they seemed to not even regard that they have killed. How much more of myself would have been sacrificed if I continued this path? How long until I took lives with just as little thought? <br>No, I refuse to go that far. Three souls, I need not even kill them but regardless of how they are collected I will never forget the three I have chosen. Even if others choose to forgive me, I will ensure I never forgive myself for it. I refuse to allow such actions to be done without thought, without regret. And should a single thing more be asked of me, I shall refuse and return home. It has to end somewhere and I will be the one making that choice. <br>I'm returning to town, I need to gather my mind and decide the next steps of my journey.]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/character-logs/thaddeus-7.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Character Logs/Thaddeus 7.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 18:34:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Leaf]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br>Winter is a sort of split world - half of the population lives within the mountains and below the frozen tundra, the other half thrive in the frosty air and icecaps.<br>
Much of Winter's strength lays within its deep connection to both elementals and beastfolk. <br>The people of Winter are, by and large, very private. Many Winter communities are hidden, with secret methods or whispered codes used to reveal the entrance. The people can be equally difficult to get to know, though once a bond of trust is formed, many in Winter will honor that bond even beyond death. <br><br><br><br>

Deep in the center of the largest desert one can find a massive plateau where a great Djinn lives, their home hidden in a perpetual sandstorm. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>]]></description><link>https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/baheera/baheera.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Locations/Prime Material Plane, Rakauvi/Baheera/Baheera.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RudyTwoSpoons]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 22:40:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hallowhymn]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Infobox
<img alt="Winter_map.jpg" src="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/lib/media/winter_map.jpg">
<br>Winter is a sort of split world - half of the population lives within the mountains and below the frozen tundra, the other half thrive in the frosty air and icecaps. <br><br>In the midst of the upheaval, many strong clans and leaders took advantage, and used the rulers' absence as a chance to grab land from other seasons until the mysterious twins <a data-href="Frost" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/winter-court/monarchs/frost.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Frost</a> and <a data-href="Thaw" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/winter-court/monarchs/thaw.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaw</a> rose as strong voices, and united the Season to lead them in defense of the realm. Much of Winter's strength lays within its deep connection to primal forces - both elemental and beastlike.<br>
<br>
The people of Winter are by and large very private. Many Winter communities are hidden, with secret methods or whispered codes used to reveal the entrance. The people can be equally difficult to get to know, though once a bond of trust is formed, many in Winter will honor that bond until death.<br>
<br><br>Even the frozen peaks of <a data-href="Nordthorn" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/prime-material-plane,-rakauvi/nordthorn/nordthorn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Nordthorn</a> cannot compare to the wind and snow of Winter. But there is a unique beauty here as well - lights of the Auroras illuminate the sky, bringing celestial spirits down to the surface.<br>
<br>
Winter is made up of dwarves, elves (especially Winter Eladrin, Moon Elves and Shadar Kai), genasi of all kinds, goblinkind, goliath, harengon, kenku, leonid, tabaxi, and shifters of every kind.<br>
<br>While in the Feywild: <br>
<br>
Do not expect <a data-href="Common" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/languages/common.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Common</a> to be spoken - many Fey will scorn those who travel to their fair realm expecting to be catered to as on the material plane. (See the back of this booklet for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Grimkin's Guide to the Winter Court > ^14fd2b" data-href="Grimkin's Guide to the Winter Court#^14fd2b" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/lore/grimkin's-guide-to-the-winter-court.html#^14fd2b" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">10 useful Sylvan phrases</a>!)

<br>
Use caution when making deals. Not every fey is looking to make off with your firstborn - but words have power. Ignorance will not excuse or exempt you from a promise made. 

<br>
Leave behind your concept of living beings vs objects. In the fey courts, brooks, boulders, branches and brambles may have sapience. Take no living wood in a forest without leaving a gift, be respectful when drawing water from a spring or well. In other words, err on the side of respect. It is not often that a mountain will wake due to disrespectful footsteps, but it is not unheard of.<br>

Helpful Tips from Experienced Travelers: 

<br>
When entering and exiting the <a data-href="Krumholtz Mountains" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/Krumholtz Mountains" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Krumholtz Mountains</a>, come prepared with a gift or performance. The clan of sprites who live in these icy cliffs are extremely private, and will deny access to those who do not bring someone to offer for their passage. Those who try to cheat them can be lost for hundreds of years, or find themselves a permanent exhibit in the fairy queen's tower. 

<br>
Winter's strength is drawn from its close ties to the elemental planes, and the courtiers will defend the balance with their lives. Events that disrupt the careful harmony will not be tolerated. No matter their private allegiances, all able Winterlings will stand together against whatever threatens their Court and Realm. 

<br>
Unlike the other Seasonal Courts, Winter has a...looser relationship with death and spirits. It is not unusual to meet a reborn or halfdead - these are intelligent beings that exist in a sort of different timeline. Additionally, there are multiple festivals and holy days dedicated to greeting spirits of those who have passed on long ago. Mausoleums and tombs are frequently visited, rather than tucked away and forgotten. If you come to the Winter to try to plunder treasure from cairns and crypts, you will be unpleasantly surprised.<br>

Archfey of the Winter Court: 

<br><a data-href="Ithiliyan" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/winter-court/archfey/ithiliyan.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ithiliyan</a> personifies compassion and hospitality, embodying the most generous side of the elemental forces that define the transition between the bitter cold and the hopeful dawn. They dwell in the Ghastalphan Mountains, a natural and magical border between the Winter and Spring courts.<br>
<br>
<a data-href="Umibuki" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/winter-court/archfey/umibuki.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Umibuki</a> is the Rootmother, a serene Archfey who keeps on good terms with <a data-href="Yatu" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/winter-court/archfey/yatu.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Yatu</a>, keeping the deep cold from freezing the forests of Winter. To her, all in the Underfey give thanks, as her mighty roots hold up the grey sky (the roofs of vast subterranean caverns where most of Winter's population resides.<br>
<br>
<a data-href="Shirosa" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/winter-court/archfey/shirosa.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Shirosa</a> is the Roaring Wind, is an Archfey of enormous power who dwells in the thickest blizzards and harshest winds. It is wise to beg her favor before travelling across open ground. There are days her fury runs so deep that only <a data-href="Ithiliyan" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/winter-court/archfey/ithiliyan.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ithiliyan</a> can calm her.<br>

<br>On the last day of autumn, when the Masking Days begin, <a data-href="Yatu" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/winter-court/archfey/yatu.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Yatu</a> travels away from Winter, bringing the first snowflakes of the year. Where snow cannot fall, he sends other signs of winter's arrival. 
<br><a data-href="Inta" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/winter-court/archfey/inta.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Inta</a> arrives as a sign that the deep cold has passed - that the bitterest temperatures are behind us, and that spring is not far off. Her arrival begins the first melt, as glacial streams and <a data-href="Mosskarm" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/winter/mosskarm.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Mosskarm</a>'s fiery maw send columns of steam up into the air, all the way to <a data-href="Solanovis" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/locations/feywild/solanovis/solanovis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Solanovis</a>.<br>
<br>
These five Archfey are intrinsically linked to the land and the weave that flows the Winter. In front of <a data-href="Frost" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/winter-court/monarchs/frost.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Frost</a> and <a data-href="Thaw" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/entities/npcs/titans/winter-court/monarchs/thaw.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Thaw</a> they may quarrel amongst themselves at times, but all serve their twin rulers with complete adoration and unwavering loyalty.<br>

Phrases in <a data-href="Sylvan" href="https://github.com/RueTooo/rueTooo.github.io/languages/sylvan.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sylvan</a>:  

<br>Hello my name is (blank) 
<br>Please/Thank you.
<br>I am from (insert kingdom/realm). 
<br>Help me.
<br>May I pass? 
<br>Please don't kill me.
<br>Yes, your teeth/claws/talons are very impressive, but in my culture we like to keep our blood inside our bodies.
<br>Is this edible? 
<br>Where is the bathroom? 
<br>I don't speak Sylvan but I am learning.
